Context: The user requires a "Total Pre-Definition" of the novel's universe. We are no longer writing chapter-by-chapter; we are building the entire database first. You must create a massive directory structure populated with DENSE, CREATIVE LORE covering history, geography, theology, and biology for the entire 24-chapter arc.

Objective: Recursively create the world_bible/ directory and populate it with the following 20+ Fundamental Files.

SECTION 1: THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD (The Deep Time)
Create Folder: world_bible/history/

# The Age of Inheritance (The Golden Age)
**Timeline:** 1,000 Years Ago.
**The State of the World:** Humanity lived in a single, boundless city called "Aethelgard."
**The Magic:** There were no Shards. Magic (Resonance) was atmospheric and free.
**The Event:** The "Great Over-Reach." Scientists tried to tap into the "Star-Altar" (The Zenith) to achieve immortality.
**The Result:** They drew the attention of Val-Kora. The Celestial arrived to "prune" the reality.

# The Shattering (The Division)
**Timeline:** 900 Years Ago.
**The Solution:** To save the world from Val-Kora, the "First Architects" split the fundamental resonance of reality into 5 Shards.
**The 5 Aspects:**
1. **Law (Gold):** Frozen order.
2. **Mind (Azure):** Pure logic.
3. **Life (Veridian):** Unchecked growth.
4. **Body (Crimson):** Physical form.
5. **Void (Violet):** The empty space between.
**The Consequence:** By separating these aspects, they broke the world into 5 distinct, extreme biomes.

Markdown

# The Edict of Names (The Modern Era)
**Timeline:** Present Day.
**The Rule:** "To Name is to Remember; To Remember is to Sin."
**The Logic:** The Magistrates believe that "Memory" triggers Resonance. If people remember the past, the Shards will wake up.
**The Implementation:** The burning of books. The censorship of "Old Words." The creation of the "Silence."

# The Physics of Shards
**Rule 1:** Shards are radioactive. They emit "Resonance."
