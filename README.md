# ZENITH

A high-fantasy arcanepunk tragedy about a librarian who becomes the living vault of the Gods.

**Status:** In Development (Phase: Fundamentals Complete).

## Core Premise
Mortals are taught the refrain, *"Mortals should not meddle with the power of the Gods"* to prevent catastrophic meddling. The Traveler — nameless, left-handed, carrying a pack of forbidden knowledge and a personal debt — discovers he can break the social law and the mechanical locks. His moral choices will either heal, replace, or doom the world.

## Key Elements
- **Prismatic imagery** and **left-hand motifs** throughout
- **Systems-minded magic** with technical consequences
- **Repeating sensory Ruination** (Name-Bleed)
- Complex political dynamics among institutions
