# ZENITH

**Status:** In Development (Phase: Fundamentals Complete).

## Core Premise
An arcanepunk tragedy following an eternal custodian on an arduous quest to secure physical fragments of divine power (God-Shards) into his own being, becoming a living vault to prevent a second apocalypse. The magic is a systemic, informational science, and the protagonist's left-handedness is a fundamental, asymmetric disadvantage he must constantly hack.

## Key Elements
- **Tangible, corrupting God-Shard artifacts**
- **Episodic, location-driven quest structure**
- **The irreversible physical cost of containing power** (Name-Bleed)
- **Systems-minded magic** with technical consequences
- **Prismatic imagery** and **left-hand motifs** throughout
- Complex political dynamics among institutions

## Narrative Inspirations & Tone
The project draws inspiration from the eternal, isolating burden of Ryze from League of Legends, the cosmic horror/library science of *The Library of Babel*, and the systemic consequences of *Fullmetal Alchemist*. The vibe is *Annihilation* meets *The Library of Babel*. Magic is not wonderous; it is a dangerous, logical system to be debugged.

## Getting Started
New contributors should first read `STYLE_GUIDE.md` and `NARRATIVE_PROTOCOL.md` to understand the project's voice and rules.
