# World Integration Map: The Shard-Scarred Lands 
 
 ## Global Mechanics 
 * **Magic:** No longer "Memory Trading." Magic is now **Arcane Radiation (Name-Bleed)** emitted by the 5 Shards. 
 * **The Economy:** Scarcity/Survival. The Virek trade in energy; the Magistrates trade in safety; the Wilds trade in blood. 
 * **The Conflict:** Maer is collecting the 5 Shards to stop the **Great Filter** (Celestial Reset). 
 
 ## Region Mapping (The 11 Zones) 
 
 ### 1. THE GOLDEN SECTOR (Law & Silence) 
 * **Regions:** **Cyris** (Capital), **Valen** (The Crossroads/Plains). 
 * **Dominant Shard:** **The Gold Shard (Law)**. 
 * **Faction:** **The Magistrates**. 
 * **Atmosphere:** White stone, oppressive silence, anti-magic fields. The air tastes like sterilized ozone. 
 * **Lore Update:** 
     * **Cyris:** The seat of High Inquisitor Oren Valis. The Gold Shard is hidden in the Citadel, enforcing the "Law of Silence." 
     * **Valen:** The controlled buffer zone. Patrols check travelers for "Radiation Sickness" (Name-Bleed). 
 
 ### 2. THE RUST SPRAWL (Mind & Industry) 
 * **Regions:** **Virek** (The Foundry), **Kallum** (The Scrapyards). 
 * **Dominant Shard:** **The Azure Shard (Mind)**. 
 * **Faction:** **The Virek Engineers** (Eldra Voss). 
 * **Atmosphere:** Smog, neon runes, grinding gears, insomnia. The radiation causes heightened intelligence but paranoia. 
 * **Lore Update:** 
     * **Virek:** The industrial heart. They are hunting the Azure Shard to power their "God-Engines." 
     * **Kallum:** The waste processing zone. Scavengers sift through "Arcane Fallout" seeking Shard-dust. 
 
 ### 3. THE ASHLANDS (Body & War) 
 * **Regions:** **Thalen** (The Volcanic Front), **Alkyr** (The War Camps). 
 * **Dominant Shard:** **The Crimson Shard (Body)**. 
 * **Faction:** **The White Hand** (Zealots). 
 * **Atmosphere:** Red skies, ash snow, boiling mud. The radiation causes flesh to mutate and harden. 
 * **Lore Update:** 
     * **Thalen:** Once verdant, now burned. The Zealots perform "Ascension Rites" here using Crimson residue. 
     * **Alkyr:** The training grounds for the mutated "Ascended" soldiers. 
 
 ### 4. THE DEEP WEALD (Root & Overgrowth) 
 * **Regions:** **Eirn** (The Frozen Wilds), **Sahru** (The Sunken Jungle). 
 * **Dominant Shard:** **The Veridian Shard (Root)**. 
 * **Faction:** **None** (Feral Beasts / Corrupted Nature). 
 * **Atmosphere:** Bioluminescence, aggressive flora, rapid growth. Time moves faster here. 
 * **Lore Update:** 
     * **Eirn:** The northern edge where the jungle meets the ice. The "Beast of Root" sleeps here. 
     * **Sahru:** A city swallowed by trees in the First Era. 
 
 ### 5. THE VOID ZONE (Entropy & Death) 
 * **Regions:** **Nyth** (The Edge), **The Hollow** (The Impact Site), **Mirel** (The Mist Coast). 
 * **Dominant Shard:** **The Violet Shard (Void)**. 
 * **Faction:** **None** (Ghosts/Echoes). 
 * **Atmosphere:** Colors are desaturated. Gravity is wrong. Sounds echo before they are made. 
 * **Lore Update:** 
     * **The Hollow:** The epicenter of the previous "Great Filter" strike. The Violet Shard is here. 
     * **Nyth & Mirel:** The quarantine zones surrounding the Hollow. Reality is thin here. 
 
 ### 6. THE ZENITH (The Goal) 
 * **Region:** **The Zenith Plateau**. 
 * **Significance:** The bridge to the Celestials (Val-Kora). The final destination. 
 
 ## Integration Checklist (For Writing) 
 * [ ] **Check the Atmosphere:** Does the region smell/feel like its Shard? (e.g., Virek = Ozone/Copper; Thalen = Sulfur/Blood). 
 * [ ] **Check the Threat:** Is the danger consistent? (Magistrates arrest you; White Hand eats you; Void erases you). 
 * [ ] **No Memory Trade:** Ensure characters are *not* trading memories for goods.
