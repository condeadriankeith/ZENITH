## Story Spine

The world of the Shattered Meridian exists in the aftermath of the Fracture (907 R), when an Arc-Foundry experiment triggered the global The Great Filter. This event activated the Meridian Locks, severing the direct authority of the Architects (Celestials) and leaving mortals to subsist on the residual authority of the Edict of Names. The Traveler, a nameless figure carrying a pack of forbidden knowledge and bearing the scar of the Spirit Mirror on his left hand, moves through this world engaging with the Meridian Lattice in ways that should be impossible. He is driven by a promise to "reweave" the world, using his mother's lullaby as an original checksum to bypass the Great Filter's rigid laws.

The central conflict revolves around the tension between the Great Filter's imperative to preserve the world's structural integrity (the Meridian Veil) and the legitimate needs of mortals who suffer from Name-Bleed and memory famine. The Traveler's unique sensitivity to the Spirit Mirror allows him to temporarily stabilize localized problems, but each intervention increases Node Entropy and risks triggering a wider Great Filter response.
