# Writer Quickstart — The Shattered Meridian

## Welcome, Author
This package transforms worldbuilding into a disciplined, cinematic writing pipeline. Follow these steps to begin writing *The Shattered Meridian*.

## 1. Pick Your Scene
Open [scene_index.md](scene_index.md) and pick a Scene ID to start. We recommend starting with the **Prologue (S-001)**.

## 2. Use the Template
1. Go to `shattered_meridian/narrative_flow/templates/`.
2. Duplicate [scene_template.md](templates/scene_template.md).
3. Name it according to the Scene ID (e.g., `S-001_prologue.md`).

## 3. Consult the Beat Sheet
Open the corresponding beat sheet in `shattered_meridian/narrative_flow/beat_sheets/` (e.g., [00_prologue.md](beat_sheets/00_prologue.md)). This contains your goals, obstacles, and sensory cues.

## 4. Write with Canon
While writing, ensure you:
- Use **prismatic imagery** for arcana.
- Keep the Traveler **nameless** and **left-handed**.
- Reference the **Three Laws of Ascension** if relevant.
- Check [epigraphs.md](epigraphs.md) for chapter openers.

## 5. Run Checks
Before submitting your draft, run the checks in [qa_checks.md](qa_checks.md) or use the [canon_check_script.md](templates/canon_check_script.md) to ensure you haven't introduced forbidden terms or broken canon.

## 6. Submit a PR
Follow the instructions in [editorial_workflow.md](editorial_workflow.md) and use the [pr_template.md](templates/pr_template.md) for your submission.

**Happy writing. Mortals should not meddle... but you must.**
