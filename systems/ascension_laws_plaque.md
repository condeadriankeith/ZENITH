# The Three Laws of Ascension

> **THE THREE LAWS OF ASCENSION**
> 1. **Irrecoverable Cost** — An ascension consumes a fragment of the aspirant; it is lost forever.
> 2. **Node Entropy** — Ascension leaves a permanent mark upon the node; repeated use risks quarantine.
> 3. **Political Targeting** — Unsanctioned Ascension invites enforcement; it cannot be completed in secret.

## Commentary

These three immutable laws form the fundamental constraints governing any ascension attempt in the Shattered Meridian world. They are not merely advisory principles but actual physical laws of the universe that manifest regardless of the aspirant's knowledge, intent, or desire.

### Law 1: Irrecoverable Cost
The first law ensures that ascension is a one-way transformation. The fragment consumed—whether a proper name, cherished memory, or lineage marker—is permanently removed from existence. It cannot be recovered through magical or mundane means. This law makes ascension a decision of ultimate consequence.

### Law 2: Node Entropy
The second law means that ascension permanently damages the metaphysical infrastructure required for the process. Each use increases the entropy of the node, making future ascensions more difficult and eventually triggering quarantine responses when thresholds are exceeded. This law makes ascension a finite resource.

### Law 3: Political Targeting
The third law means that ascension cannot be achieved in isolation. The act generates detectable signatures that alert various institutions and enforcement mechanisms. This law makes ascension a political act with social consequences.

## Historical Context

These laws became widely understood after the First False Ascension in Sahru (972 R), when King Haraes attempted unsanctioned ascension and suffered catastrophic failure. The resulting Ruination—the Black Sands—served as a grim reminder of the consequences of violating these fundamental principles.

## Implications for the Traveler

The Traveler's unique ability to engage in ascension-related activities while surviving the consequences stems not from immunity to these laws, but from his composite, prismatic approach to magic. However, he remains subject to all three laws, which drives much of the narrative tension in his journey.
