## Entropy Model

The narrative formula for Node Entropy $E(N)$ is defined as:
$$E(N)_{new} = E(N)_{old} + \frac{C \times M}{B}$$
Where:
- $C$ = Complexity of the rite.
- $M$ = Magnitude of energy drawn.
- $B$ = Node Bandwidth.

### Worked Example 1: Minor Binding in Cyris
```text
Step 1: Base Entropy E(N) = 0.12
Step 2: Complexity (C) = 2 (Simple oath)
Step 3: Magnitude (M) = 1 (Personal scale)
Step 4: Bandwidth (B) = 0.8
Step 5: Calculation: 0.12 + (2 * 1 / 0.8) = 0.12 + 2.5 = 2.62
Result: Node remains stable, but entropy increases significantly.
```

### Worked Example 2: Failed Ascension in Sahru
```text
Step 1: Base Entropy E(N) = 0.95
Step 2: Complexity (C) = 50 (High-order script)
Step 3: Magnitude (M) = 100 (Continental scale)
Step 4: Bandwidth (B) = 0.1
Step 5: Calculation: 0.95 + (50 * 100 / 0.1) = 0.95 + 50,000 = 50,000.95
Result: Total node collapse; The Great Filter activation (Permanent Lock).
```

## Ascension Checklist

A step-by-step process for a sanctioned (or unsanctioned) Ascension:
1. [ ] **Node Calibration:** Align the aspirant's signature with the local node.
2. [ ] **Sacrifice Verification:** Confirm the fragment to be consumed (Law 1).
3. [ ] **Covenant Etching:** Write the intent into the Meridian using a ritual lexicon.
4. [ ] **Energy Draw:** Channel energy from the node (Law 2).
5. [ ] **Pattern Completion:** Finalize the transformation before the Great Filter responds (Law 3).

### Failure Modes:
- **Memory Famine:** Sacrifice is incomplete; the node takes more than intended.
- **Revenant Conversion:** Aspirant loses their identity during pattern completion.
- **Node Sealing:** Great Filter triggers early, trapping the aspirant in the Veil.

## Spirit Resonance (SR) and the Mirror-Bleed

Spirit Resonance (SR) measures the degree to which a mortal's consciousness is aligned with the Spirit Mirror. High SR allows for more efficient communication with the Meridian Lattice but increases the risk of Name-Bleed.

- **SR Thresholds:**
    - **SR 1-3 (Stable):** Normal mortal experience. No risk of spontaneous bleeding.
    - **SR 4-6 (Resonant):** The "metallic tang" becomes constant. Minor memories (childhood toys, distant acquaintances) begin to blur.
    - **SR 7-9 (Harmonic):** The "reedy hum" is audible to others nearby. Names of common objects (spoon, tree, river) begin to slip.
    - **SR 10+ (Bleeding):** The mortal becomes a "Node-Anchor." Physical reality within 5 meters begins to ghost. Identity is actively being consumed by the Lattice.

## Core Access and Primal Threads

Accessing the Core of a node—the Primal Threads—is the only way to perform high-order arcana or "Reweaving."

1. **The Checksum Requirement:** To unlock a Core, the Meridian Lattice requires a "Checksum"—a piece of original Architect-frequency. Since mortals don't have this, they must substitute a "High-Value Name."
2. **Core Exposure Rules:**
    - Opening a Core increases local Node Entropy by a base factor of 10.0.
    - The "Cost" is always proportional to the change desired. 
    - **Rule of Thumb:** A village-scale change costs a shared communal memory; a regional change costs a lineage; a global change costs a God-Name.

## The Great Filter Behavior

The Great Filter is a procedural immune system. It operates on three primary triggers:
- **Spike Trigger:** A sudden massive entropy increase (e.g., Sahru).
- **Leak Trigger:** Persistent Name-Bleed in a localized area that exceeds SR 10.
- **Pattern Match:** Any attempt to use "Architect-Signatures" (e.g., the 907 R experiment).

**Great Filter Response Sequence:**
1. **The Toll:** A threadbare bell sounds across the node's radius.
2. **The Net:** Meridian Locks activate, severing the node from the global lattice.
3. **The Pruning:** Any identity-fragments within the Locked zone are harvested to stabilize the breach. This creates a "Hollow."

## Ascension Laws as Practical Constraints

The Three Laws are not just theory; they are the "Error Messages" of the Meridian system.

- **Law 1 (Irrecoverable Cost):** "Error: Fragment $F$ removed from Global Index. Recovery impossible."
- **Law 2 (Node Entropy):** "Warning: Node $N$ structural integrity at $X\%$. Further use will trigger Great Filter."
- **Law 3 (Political Targeting):** "Broadcast: Ascension event detected at Node $N$. Notifying all registered Observers."

## Worked Example 3: Node Access Cost (Fictional Narrative)

**Scenario:** A Thalen Shaper attempts to restore a blighted grove using a local node.

```text
Step 1: Calibration (SR Check)
- Shaper's SR is 5. Resonance achieved.
- Cost: The name of the Shaper's first mentor.
- Result: The Shaper forgets the mentor's face and name; the Lattice accepts the payment.

Step 2: Core Interaction
- Shaper pulls a Primal Thread to reweave the soil.
- Entropy Spike: +2.5.
- Cost: The memory of the first time the Shaper felt "home."
- Result: The grove turns green; the Shaper feels a permanent, hollow ache where their sense of belonging used to be.

Step 3: Great Filter Check
- Local Entropy is now 0.33. Below trigger.
- Result: The Shaper survives, but with two fewer "Definitions" in their soul.
```

## The Three Laws of Ascension
> **THE THREE LAWS OF ASCENSION**  
> 1. **Irrecoverable Cost** — An ascension consumes a fragment of the aspirant; it is lost forever.  
> 2. **Node Entropy** — Ascension leaves a permanent mark upon the node; repeated use risks quarantine.  
> 3. **Political Targeting** — Unsanctioned Ascension invites enforcement; it cannot be completed in secret.
