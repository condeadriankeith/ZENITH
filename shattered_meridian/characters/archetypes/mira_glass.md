Mira Glass — The Prism-Witness

Slug: mira_glass.md
Region: Cyris

A sharp-eyed and obsessive archivist for the Cyris Covenant, Mira is responsible for the recording and verification of the region's "Prism-Memories"—visual records of the past stored in high-purity glass crystals. She is a woman of intense focus and little patience for distraction, her life dedicated to the preservation of the city's history.

Mira is a tall, slender woman with skin the color of frosted glass. She wears a series of "Prism-Lenses"—specialized glass plates used for viewing and projecting memories—strapped to her arms and neck. Her hair is a short, practical crop of white-grey, and her eyes are a sharp, piercing silver. She carries a "Glass-Cane"—a long, obsidian staff etched with recording-glyphs. She smells of old paper, ozone, and the sharp, antiseptic scent of node-residue.

Mira serves as a source of historical knowledge and a complicated ally. She provides the Traveler with the "Prism-Lenses" needed to see the hidden node-paths of Cyris and helps them understand the dangerous potential of the city's failing architecture.

The soft, rhythmic *click-clack* of the glass lenses on her arms and the bright, shimmering light that emanates from her cane whenever she is working.

Mira seeks to preserve the history of Cyris, yet she is haunted by the realization that the very history she is recording is the primary source of the "Friction" that is accelerating the city's decay.

- Act I — Ch. 4 (The Great Library): Mira intercepts the Traveler as they search for information on the Fracture, testing their "Resonance" and eventually granting them a single "Prism-Lens" for protection.
- Act II — Ch. 18 (The Hall of Memories): Mira and the Traveler navigate a maze of "Memory-Traps," a journey that requires Mira to use her lenses to find a safe path through the burning energy.
- Act III — Ch. 30 (The Final Record): Mira stays behind to defend the library against a wave of "Absence-Wraiths," using her cane to "anchor" the history against the advancing Absence.

The Great Library of Cyris was a cathedral of white light and constant, rhythmic *click-clacking*, the air thick with the scent of old paper and the sharp, antiseptic scent of node-residue. Mira Glass stood at the center of the library, her cane glowing with a bright, shimmering light as she projected a series of prism-memories onto the walls.

"The past is moving, Traveler," Mira said, her voice a sharp, clinical rasp. She didn't look up as the Traveler approached, her focus entirely on the memories. "And it's not moving according to the records. The node-jitter is reaching critical levels, and the history is starting to blur." She stepped back from the wall, her silver eyes wide with a mixture of obsession and terror. "The Fracture isn't just a crack in the world. It's an erasure. And if we don't find a way to stop it, there won't be any history left to guard." She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, glass lens. "Take this. It'll tell you when the world is about to turn into a blank page. And believe me, where you're going, that happens more often than you'd think."

> 
> *Archivist:* Mira Glass
> *Location:* The Great Library (Sector 4).
> *Observation:* The memory-jitter is exceeding safety parameters. The Covenant is failing.
> *Action:* Applied temporary 'Prism-Patch' using 15kg of refined node-residue. 
> *Notes:* The patch is holding, but the underlying lattice is brittle. We're fighting a losing battle. A stranger with a 'Static-Name' passed through the library today. I've given him a lens and a path. He moves like he's already part of the Absence. I'll follow him for a while. If he reaches the Hollow, the history will finally be at peace.

"The past isn't a gift; it's a contract. And right now, the contract is being cancelled."
"I don't care about your destiny. I care about the records. And the records don't lie."
"Every memory has a weight. And you're carrying far too much, Traveler."

Mira begins as a stoic and dedicated archivist, viewing the world's decay as just another record to be filed. Through her interactions with the Traveler, she realizes that her "preservation" is actually a race against time. She moves from being a "recorder of memories" to a "forger of hope," eventually choosing to use her glass-cane to provide the Traveler with the "Legal-Key" needed to reach the Hollow's core.

### Supplemental Lore: The Prism-Memories of Cyris

In the white cliffs of Cyris, history is a form of "Metaphysical Evidence." The "Prism-Memories" that govern the region's archives are not just visual records; they are "Resonant-Crystals" that contain the visual and emotional weight of the past. The "Prism-Witnesses" are the practitioners of this art.

They are trained to perceive the "Discord" caused by historical decay—a subtle, vibrating heat that emanates from those memories that are no longer in sync with the Covenant. By viewing specific "Prism-Lenses" and applying different types of "Glass-Patches" to these crystals, a witness can restore the city's stability. However, the process is extremely taxing on the witness's mind and body. Constant exposure to the raw energy of the crystals can lead to "Prism-Sickness," a condition where the witness's own skin takes on the texture of frosted glass, as they literally become part of the history they serve.

### The Glass-Cane of Mira

Mira’s cane is more than a tool; it is a "Metaphysical Siphon."

1. **The Obsidian-Staff:** Provides the resonance needed to channel the energy of the prism-memories.
2. **The Recording-Glyphs:** Etched into the staff, these glyphs allow Mira to "hook" a specific memory and pull it from the crystals.

### Fragment from an Archivist's Notebook

> The Traveler's resonance is... static. He doesn't shimmer. He doesn't blur. He just IS. I've tried to record him, but the crystals won't take. It's like his heart is made of the same stone as the Hollow. If he stays in the library, he'll break all my memories. But if he leaves, he'll never find the center of the story. I'll give him the Lens. Maybe if he carries a piece of the past, he'll start to move with us.
