Sera of the Tide — The Salt-Bound Oracle

Slug: sera_of_the_tide.md
Region: Kallum

A blind seer who reads the oily iridescence of the Kallum tides, Sera trades fragments of her own future for glimpses of the world’s decaying nodes. She is the only one who hears the "breathing" of the deep Meridian.

Sera stands on the bone-white docks of Kallum, her eyes milky and unseeing, veiled by a thin strip of translucent sea-silk. Her skin is weathered like driftwood, etched with salt-crust patterns that shimmer when the tide rises. She wears a heavy cloak of matted kelp-fiber, and her fingers are stained indigo from the ink of ledger-bones she carries in a bundle at her hip.

Sera serves as a reluctant mentor and harbinger, providing the Traveler with the sensory keys needed to navigate the shifting node-lines of the coast. She is a source of cryptic warnings and deep-world lore.

The rhythmic clicking of ledger-bones against her hip and the smell of ozone and brine that precedes her arrival.

Sera claims to protect the memories of the sea, yet she sells her own childhood recollections to the tide-merchants to pay for the "sight" needed to save others.

- Act I — Ch. 4 (The Salt-Bleached Docks): Sera senses the Traveler's arrival and warns them of the "silence" growing in the deep nodes, providing the first hint of the Fracture's deepening.
- Act II — Ch. 12 (The Oily Reach): Sera guides the Traveler through a submerged node-path, sacrificing a vital memory to keep the path open against the rising pressure.
- Act III — Ch. 22 (The Tide's End): Sera witnesses the final collapse of the Kallum node and gives the Traveler her last ledger-bone, containing the coordinates of the Hollow.

The mist was thick enough to chew, a heavy blanket of salt and old regrets that clung to the Traveler’s cloak. At the edge of the pier, where the wood gave way to the churning, iridescent black of the Kallum tide, stood a figure as still as a grave-marker. Sera didn't turn when the Traveler approached; she didn't need to. The clicking of her ledger-bones slowed to a rhythmic pulse, matching the heavy heartbeat of the sea.

"You smell of land-dust and desperation," she said, her voice a low rasp that carried over the crashing waves. She reached into the water, her hand disappearing into the oily shimmer. When she pulled it back, her palm was coated in a thick, glowing residue that dripped like liquid starlight. "The nodes are holding their breath, Traveler. And you are the exhale they’ve been waiting for." She held out her hand, the residue beginning to etch a map of light onto the air between them. "Do you have a memory to spare? Or will you pay with your name?"

> *Service:* Passage through the Shifting Estuary.
> *Notes:* The memory was particularly vivid. The Oracle wept as she consumed it. The ink on the bone turned a deep violet, indicating a high Meridian resonance. The Traveler remains unaware of the price of their passage.

"The tide doesn't take what it doesn't need. It only takes what you're too heavy to carry."
"Don't look at the waves, Traveler. Look at the space between them. That's where the truth is hiding."
"Every name is a weight. Some of us just choose to sink faster."

Sera begins as a detached observer of the world's end, convinced that the decay is inevitable. Through her interactions with the Traveler, she regains a sense of agency, eventually choosing to sacrifice her final tether to the world to ensure the Traveler reaches the Hollow. She transforms from a passive seer to an active participant in the world's re-tuning.

### Supplemental Lore: The Rites of the Salt-Bound

The Salt-Bound are not born; they are made by the sea. In the region of Kallum, those who lose their way—either through debt, madness, or a desire for forbidden knowledge—often find themselves at the edge of the Bone-Docks. There, they perform the *Rite of the Oily Veil*. 

It is said that the Meridian Lattice, which governs the world's physical laws, is at its thinnest over the deep waters of the Kallum coast. The Salt-Bound exploit this thinness. By ingesting the "Node-Residue"—the glowing, iridescent oil that leaks from the submerged Meridian Cores—they gain the ability to perceive the world's underlying structure. But the price is steep. The residue is a solvent for identity. It dissolves the user's memories, starting with the most recent and working backward toward birth.

Sera, once a prominent scholar of the Cyris Codex, fled to Kallum after a failed attempt to "re-tune" a minor node resulted in the erasure of her entire family's names. She became Salt-Bound to find a way to restore what she had lost, only to realize that the sea only takes; it never gives back.

### The Ledger-Bones of Sera

Sera carries a bundle of twenty-four ledger-bones, each carved from the rib of a deep-sea leviathan. These bones are not just records; they are physical manifestations of the debts she has brokered. When she "reads" the tide, she uses these bones as tuning forks, striking them against the wood of the docks to find the resonance of the nodes.

1. **The First Bone:** Carved with the glyph for *Silence*. Used to detect node-decay.
2. **The Ninth Bone:** Carved with the glyph for *Flow*. Used to navigate current-locks.
3. **The Final Bone:** Blank, awaiting the name of the one who will end the Fracture.

### Fragment from a Discarded Journal

> I saw him today. The one they call the Traveler. He doesn't know he's carrying the weight of a thousand unsaid names. His shadow is too long for the sun we have left. I wanted to tell him to run, to throw his compass into the oily deep and never look back. But the bones clicked 'Yes', and the tide whispered 'Soon'. I took his memory of a warm loaf of bread. It tasted like ash and hope. I think I'll keep that one for a while.
