Juno Tick-Meri — The Caravan-Clock

Slug: juno_tick_meri.md
Region: Valen

A master navigator and time-keeper for the Great Crossroads of Valen, Juno uses a complex array of "Tick-Gears" to predict the shifting node-patterns of the central plains. She is a woman of frantic energy and mechanical precision, her life governed by the rhythmic ticking of the world's pulse.

Juno is short and wiry, her skin tanned a deep bronze by the sun of the plains. She is covered in pockets and pouches, each containing a different type of clock, compass, or gear. She wears a heavy leather vest with a massive, glowing "Tick-Gear" embedded in the chest, which pulses in time with the nearest Meridian Node. Her hair is a chaotic nest of copper wire and small bells that jingle when she moves. She smells of dry grass, machine oil, and the sharp, metallic scent of heated copper.

Juno acts as a guide and logistical expert. She provides the Traveler with the "Time-Gears" needed to navigate the node-storms of the plains and helps them coordinate their movements with the shifting rhythms of the world.

The constant, rhythmic *tick-tock* of the gears on her chest and the frantic jingle of the bells in her hair.

Juno is obsessed with precision and timing, yet she lives in a world where time itself is becoming erratic and unreliable due to the Fracture, leading her to suffer from "Chronological Vertigo."

- Act I — Ch. 16 (The Great Crossroads): Juno saves the Traveler’s caravan from a sudden node-shift, using her gears to "anchor" the group in time while the world shifts around them.
- Act II — Ch. 28 (The Dust-Clock Desert): Juno and the Traveler navigate a desert where time flows at different speeds; Juno must manually "wind" the group's internal clocks to keep them from aging or de-aging into oblivion.
- Act III — Ch. 36 (The Final Second): Juno provides the Traveler with the "Master-Gear"—a device that can temporarily pause the decay of a node—allowing the Traveler to reach the Hollow’s core during a total node-collapse.

The plains of Valen were a sea of golden grass, waving in a wind that didn't just carry dust, but the faint, stuttering echoes of yesterday. Juno Tick-Meri was knee-deep in the grass, her hands blurred as she adjusted the gears on a portable brass tripod. The *tick-tock* from her chest-gear was fast today, a frantic, racing pulse that made the bells in her hair jingle like a warning.

"Too slow, too slow!" Juno muttered, her voice a rapid-fire staccato. She didn't look up as the Traveler approached, her focus entirely on the tripod. "The 4:15 node-shift is coming at 4:12, and if we aren't synchronized by then, we're going to end up in last Tuesday, and I *hate* last Tuesday. It was very dusty." She grabbed a small copper wrench and gave a gear a sharp twist. The tripod emitted a low, satisfied hum. She finally looked up, her eyes wide and bloodshot. "You're late, Traveler. Three minutes and twelve seconds late. In this world, that's enough time for the ground to turn into a ceiling. Do you have a watch? Or do you just guess when the world is going to end?"

> *Route:* The Golden Crossroads to the Sahru Edge.
> *Status:* Delayed. Node-jitter in Sector 4 is exceeding safety parameters.
> *Notes:* Juno Tick-Meri has been assigned as the primary time-keeper. Her 'Chronological Vertigo' is worsening; she attempted to wind the sun yesterday. 
> *Incident:* A stranger with a 'Static-Resonance' joined the caravan. Juno claims he is 'Out of Sync' with the world's pulse. She's obsessed with 're-winding' him. 
> *Signed — Caravan Master Kaelen*

"Time isn't a river; it's a clock. And right now, the spring is about to snap."
"If you're on time, you're late. If you're early, you're safe. If you're me, you're terrified."
"Don't listen to the wind. Listen to the tick. The tick is the only thing that's real."

Juno begins as a woman driven by a desperate need for control, using her clocks and gears to impose order on a world that is falling apart. As she travels with the Traveler and sees that the "machine" of time is fundamentally broken, she learns to embrace the "Un-Sync." She moves from trying to "fix" the clock to helping the Traveler "reset" it, eventually giving her Master-Gear to the Traveler and accepting her own place in the final, timeless moment of the world.

### Supplemental Lore: The Tick-Gears of Valen

In the central plains of Valen, the Meridian Lattice is particularly sensitive to the passage of time. The "Tick-Gears" are devices created by the Caravan Guild to monitor and influence the "Chronological Pulse" of the local nodes.

These gears are not mechanical in the traditional sense; they are "Resonant Oscillators" that vibrate in sympathy with the world's energetic heartbeat. By adjusting the tension and frequency of these gears, a skilled Time-Keeper can create small "Pockets of Stability" where time flows at a normal rate, even during a node-storm. However, the cost of this stability is "Chronological Vertigo"—a condition where the user's own internal sense of time becomes detached from reality, leading to hallucinations, memory loss, and a frantic, obsessive need to monitor every passing second.

### The Tripod of Juno

Juno’s portable navigation tripod is her most prized possession. It is a "Multi-Dimensional Sextant" used to map the shifting node-paths of the plains.

1. **The Chrono-Lens:** A lens made of compressed time-residue that allows the user to see "Shadow-Paths"—routes that existed in the past or might exist in the future.
2. **The Anchor-Weights:** Heavy brass spheres that keep the tripod—and its user—from being blown away by a node-shift.

### Fragment from a Frantic Note

> The Traveler is 'Static'. He doesn't tick. He doesn't tock. He just... IS. I've tried to wind him, but the key won't turn. It's like his heart is made of the same stone as the Hollow. If he stays with the caravan, he'll break all my clocks. But if he leaves, we'll never find the center of the storm. I'll give him the Second-Gear. Maybe if he carries a piece of time, he'll start to move with us.
