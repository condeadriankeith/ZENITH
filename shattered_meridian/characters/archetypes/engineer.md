# Archetype: The Engineer (Virek)

## Appearance
- **Clothing:** Oily leather aprons and brass-rimmed goggles.
- **Tools:** Runic wrenches and steam-pressure gauges.
- **Markings:** Faint schematic-like burns on the forearms.

## Speech Samples
- "Check the bandwidth; the node is peaking."
- "This rune is out of patent; it's a safety risk."
- "The Mercury-Keel didn't fail; it was just ahead of its time."

## Signature Magic
- **Technomancy:** Etching functional runes into brass and iron.
- **Cost:** Material consumption; Engineers are always hunting for rare ores and node-residue.

## Moral Contradictions
- They value efficiency and logic, yet their industry creates the very "entropy" that threatens the world.
- They claim to serve progress, but their guilds are more interested in protecting patents.

## Arc Beats
1. **The Invention:** Creating a device that uses 10% less Meridian energy.
2. **The Rupture:** Surviving a foundry explosion caused by a Quarantine Lock.
3. **The Discovery:** Finding a way to "re-tune" a minor node without triggering a seal.
