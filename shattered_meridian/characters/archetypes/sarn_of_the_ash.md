Sarn of the Ash — The Ash-Walker

Slug: sarn_of_the_ash.md
Region: Sahru

A young but experienced survivalist from the sunken wastes of Sahru, Sarn has spent his entire life navigating the black sands and glass-fused ruins of the region. He is a master of "Ash-Breathing," a technique that allows him to survive the toxic name-bleed of the wastes.

Sarn is short and wiry, his skin a deep, sun-baked brown. He wears a heavy, multi-layered cloak of grey, ash-stained cloth and a mask made of bone and leather that filters the air. His eyes are a bright, piercing blue, often the only part of his face visible. He carries a long, notched staff and a bag filled with "Residue-Cores"—small, glowing stones that provide light and heat in the cold nights of the desert. He smells of dry sand, burnt glass, and the sharp, metallic scent of ozone.

Sarn serves as a guide and scout. He provides the Traveler with the "Ash-Masks" needed to survive the toxic environment of Sahru and helps them navigate the deceptive and dangerous terrain of the wastes.

The soft, rhythmic *crunch* of his boots on the glass-sand and the low, muffled sound of his breathing through the bone-mask.

Sarn is a survivor who values his independence above all else, yet he finds himself drawn to the Traveler’s mission, realizing that his own survival is meaningless if the world itself is dying.

- Act I — Ch. 12 (The Black Sand Sea): Sarn saves the Traveler from a "Name-Swarm," a group of hungry revenants, and agrees to guide them across the wastes to a hidden node.
- Act II — Ch. 24 (The Glass-Ruins): Sarn and the Traveler infiltrate a ruined city to retrieve a "Node-Crystal," a journey that requires Sarn to use his "Ash-Breathing" to navigate a toxic node-leak.
- Act III — Ch. 36 (The Final Step): Sarn provides the Traveler with the "Residue-Filter"—a device that can temporarily neutralize the Name-Bleed—allowing the Traveler to reach the Hollow’s entrance.

The wind in Sahru was a physical weight, carrying the fine, black dust of a billion forgotten lives. The Traveler was struggling to breathe, every gasp of air tasting of ash and old copper. Then, a figure appeared out of the swirling dust, his bone-mask glowing with a faint, blue light. Sarn didn't say a word; he just grabbed the Traveler’s arm and pulled them behind a large, fused-glass pillar.

"Breathe slow," Sarn said, his voice muffled by the mask. He pulled a small, glowing stone from his bag and held it out. "The ash here is full of names. If you breathe too much of it, you'll forget who you are. And once you forget, the shadows will take what's left." He waited until the Traveler’s breathing had stabilized, then he peeked around the pillar. "The node-storm is passing, but the revenants are still out there. They're hungry today. They can smell the 'Static' on you." He looked at the Traveler, his blue eyes bright with curiosity. "You're not from here. You're from the 'Before'. I can help you cross the wastes, but it'll cost you a story. A real one. Not one of the ones the sand tells."

> *Entry:* 909 R, Cycle 2
> *Location:* The Glass-Ruins (Sector 7).
> *Observation:* The Name-Bleed is getting thicker. Even the Ash-Breathers are starting to feel the 'Echo-Sickness'. 
> *Action:* Salvaged three 'Residue-Cores' from a dead construct.
> *Notes:* A stranger passed through the ruins today. He had a compass that didn't tick. I gave him a mask and a stone. He gave me a story about a place with green grass and blue water. I think he was lying, but it was a good story. I'll follow him for a while. If the shadows take him, I'll take his compass. It's the only thing in this desert that looks like it's worth anything.

"The sand doesn't care about your name. It only cares about your bones."
"Don't listen to the whispers. They're just the echoes of people who weren't fast enough."
"Breathe the ash. Let it remind you that you're still alive."

Sarn begins as a purely self-interested survivalist, viewing the world's decay as a personal challenge. Through his interactions with the Traveler, he realizes that "survival" is not just about staying alive, but about preserving something worth living for. He moves from being a "scavenger of ghosts" to a "guardian of life," eventually giving his final "Residue-Core"—the only thing keeping him alive—to save the Traveler from a total node-collapse.

### Supplemental Lore: The Ash-Breathing of Sahru

In the sunken wastes of Sahru, the air is not just dusty; it is "Metaphysically Toxic." The "Name-Bleed" from the region's failing nodes has saturated the environment with "Identity-Residue"—the fragments of erased names and memories. Breathing this residue causes "Echo-Sickness," a condition where the victim's own memories and sense of self are gradually replaced by the fragments they have inhaled.

The "Ash-Breathers" of Sahru have developed a series of techniques to survive in this environment. The most important is the use of "Bone-Masks"—filters made from the porous bones of ancient leviathans, treated with node-oil. These masks can filter out the largest fragments of residue, but they are not perfect. Ash-Breathers must also practice "Mental-Anchoring," a meditative technique where they focus on a single, unchanging memory to maintain their sense of self.

### The Staff of Sarn

Sarn’s staff is a "Vibration-Sensor."

1. **The Notched Edge:** Each notch represents a different type of node-resonance, allowing Sarn to "feel" the health of the ground.
2. **The Core-Socket:** A small opening at the top of the staff where a Residue-Core can be inserted to provide light and heat.

### Fragment from a Scoured Journal

> He doesn't breathe like the rest of us. He doesn't struggle. It's like the ash doesn't see him. I've watched him walk through a name-storm without a mask, and the shadows just... moved aside. He's not a man. He's a 'Hole' in the world. I'm going to give him the Filter. If he's a hole, maybe he can swallow the Absence. Or maybe he'll just swallow us all.
