Eldra Voss — The Steam-Prophet

Slug: eldra_voss.md
Region: Virek

A fanatical and brilliant inventor from the soot-stained city of Virek, Eldra is a "Steam-Prophet"—a specialized technomancer who believes that the Fracture can be harnessed and controlled through the use of high-pressure node-energy. She is a woman of intense energy and little regard for safety, her life dedicated to the creation of the "Grand Engine."

Eldra is a small, energetic woman with skin the color of coal-dust and grease. She wears a suit of rugged, steam-stained leather and a series of "Pressure-Gauges"—specialized mechanical devices used for monitoring node-activity—strapped to her arms and neck. Her hair is a wild, unkempt mane of bright red, and her eyes are a sharp, piercing orange. She carries a "Steam-Wrench"—a massive, iron tool etched with technomancy-glyphs. She smells of coal-smoke, ozone, and the sharp, metallic scent of heated brass.

Eldra serves as an inventor and a source of technological support. She provides the Traveler with the "Pressure-Gauges" needed to monitor the local node-activity and helps them understand the dangerous potential of the region's failing technology.

The constant, rhythmic *hiss-clank* of the steam-engines and the bright, bird-like whistle she uses to signal her presence.

Eldra seeks to control the world's decay through technology, yet she is haunted by the realization that the very "Steam-Engines" she spends her life building are the primary source of the "Friction" that is accelerating the city's decay.

- Act I — Ch. 4 (The Brass Foundry): Eldra saves the Traveler from a "Steam-Burst"—a sudden release of high-pressure node-energy—and eventually agrees to repair the Traveler's equipment.
- Act II — Ch. 18 (The High Works): Eldra and the Traveler navigate a maze of "Pipe-Traps," a journey that requires Eldra to use her wrench to find a safe path through the burning energy.
- Act III — Ch. 30 (The Final Engine): Eldra stays behind to defend the foundry against a wave of "Absence-Wraiths," using her wrench to "anchor" the technology against the advancing Absence.

The foundries of Virek were a cathedral of black smoke and constant, rhythmic *hiss-clanking*, the air thick with the scent of coal-smoke and the sharp, metallic scent of heated brass. Eldra Voss stood at the center of the foundry, her wrench glowing with a bright, orange light as she adjusted a series of pressure-gauges on a massive engine.

"The pressure is rising, Traveler," Eldra said, her voice a quick, bird-like chirp. She didn't look up as the Traveler approached, her focus entirely on the engine. "And it's not rising according to the gauges. The node-jitter is reaching critical levels, and the steam is starting to boil." She stepped back from the engine, her orange eyes wide with a mixture of fanatacism and terror. "The Fracture isn't just a crack in the world. It's a boiler-explosion. And if we don't find a way to vent it, there won't be any technology left to guard." She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, ticking gauge. "Take this. It'll tell you when the world is about to turn into a explosion. And believe me, where you're going, that happens more often than you'd think."

> *Technomancer:* Eldra Voss
> *Location:* The High Works (Sector 4).
> *Observation:* The pressure-jitter is exceeding safety parameters. The Guild is failing.
> *Action:* Applied temporary 'Steam-Patch' using 15kg of refined node-residue. 
> *Notes:* The patch is holding, but the underlying lattice is brittle. We're fighting a losing battle. A stranger with a 'Static-Name' passed through the works today. I've given him a gauge and a path. He moves like he's already part of the Absence. I'll follow him for a while. If he reaches the Hollow, the technology will finally be at peace.

"The world isn't a machine; it's a boiler. And right now, the safety-valves are stuck."
"I don't care about your destiny. I care about the pressure. And the pressure doesn't lie."
"Every gear has a weight. And you're carrying far too much, Traveler."

Eldra begins as a fanatical and dedicated inventor, viewing the world's decay as just another problem to be solved with technology. Through her interactions with the Traveler, she realizes that her "inventions" are actually a race against time. She moves from being a "prophet of steam" to a "forger of hope," eventually choosing to use her steam-wrench to provide the Traveler with the "Mechanical-Key" needed to reach the Hollow's core.

### Supplemental Lore: The Steam-Prophecy of Virek

In the soot-stained city of Virek, technology is a form of "Metaphysical Engineering." The "Steam-Engines" that power the city are not just mechanical devices; they are "Resonant-Boilers" that use high-pressure node-energy to generate work and heat. The "Steam-Prophets" are the practitioners of this art.

They are trained to perceive the "Discord" caused by technological decay—a subtle, vibrating heat that emanates from those engines that are no longer in sync with the Guild’s laws. By viewing specific "Pressure-Gauges" and applying different types of "Steam-Patches" to these engines, a prophet can restore the city's stability. However, the process is extremely taxing on the prophet's mind and body. Constant exposure to the raw energy of the steam can lead to "Boiler-Sickness," a condition where the prophet's own skin takes on the texture of soot-stained leather, as they literally become part of the technology they serve.

### The Steam-Wrench of Eldra

Eldra’s wrench is more than a tool; it is a "Metaphysical Siphon."

1. **The Iron-Tool:** Provides the leverage needed to adjust and repair the hardest machinery.
2. **The Technomancy-Glyphs:** Etched into the tool, these glyphs allow Eldra to "hook" a specific frequency and pull it from the engines.

### Fragment from an Inventor's Notebook

> The Traveler's resonance is... static. He doesn't hiss. He doesn't clank. He just IS. I've tried to measure him, but the gauges won't take. It's like his heart is made of the same stone as the Hollow. If he stays in the foundry, he'll break all my engines. But if he leaves, he'll never find the center of the pressure. I'll give him the Gauge. Maybe if he carries a piece of the machine, he'll start to move with us.
