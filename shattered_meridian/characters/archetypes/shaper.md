# Archetype: The Shaper (Thalen)

## Appearance
- **Clothing:** Woven vine-wraps and sap-stained tunics.
- **Tools:** A "Singing Knife" for pruning spirit-growth.
- **Markings:** Prismatic green-gold veins on the neck and wrists.

## Speech Samples
- "Listen to the rings; the grove remembers."
- "A name is not given; it is grown."
- "The sap flows thick today; the node is restless."

## Signature Magic
- **Spirit Magic:** Encouraging plants and structures to grow into desired shapes.
- **Cost:** Empathy drain; Shapers often become more connected to the grove than to their own families.

## Moral Contradictions
- They preach harmony with nature, but they "prune" spirits that do not conform to their cultural needs.
- They claim to be stewards, but they are often the first to exploit a new spirit-emergence.

## Arc Beats
1. **The Naming:** Successfully growing a spirit-bridge for the community.
2. **The Rejection:** A grove refuses a Shaper's song, indicating deep node corruption.
3. **The Sacrifice:** Trading a personal memory to heal a dying "Place-Spirit."
