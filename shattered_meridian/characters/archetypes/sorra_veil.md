Sorra Veil — The Veil-Walker

Slug: sorra_veil.md
Region: Alkyr

A daring and ethereal scout from the Starward Climb, Sorra uses "Aether-Wings"—a harness of light and glass—to navigate the higher-order structures of the Meridian Veil. She is a woman of boundless curiosity and reckless courage, her life spent in the thin air and blinding light of the sky.

Sorra is lithe and agile, her skin a deep, sun-kissed bronze decorated with swirling patterns of glowing white aether-ink. She wears a tight-fitting suit of silver-leafed leather and a complex harness of glass plates and copper wires that extend from her back like the wings of a dragonfly. Her eyes are a bright, piercing gold, and she carries a small, brass "Aether-Compass" that she uses to find the invisible paths in the sky. She smells of ozone, cold air, and the sharp, metallic scent of aether.

Sorra serves as a scout and guide to the world's higher reaches. She provides the Traveler with the "Aether-Lens" needed to see the hidden node-paths in the sky and helps them navigate the dangerous and deceptive environment of the Veil.

The soft, rhythmic *hum-whirr* of her aether-wings and the way the air around her seems to vibrate with a faint, white light.

Sorra seeks to explore the ultimate boundaries of the universe, yet she is haunted by the realization that the world she loves is being consumed by the "Absence"—a void that is slowly erasing the very paths she spends her life mapping.

- Act I — Ch. 14 (The Sky-Islands): Sorra saves the Traveler from a "Veil-Rupture," using her wings to carry them across a gap in reality and eventually agreeing to scout the path to the higher nodes.
- Act II — Ch. 26 (The Starward Ascent): Sorra and the Traveler navigate a maze of "Aether-Currents," a journey that requires Sorra to manually adjust her wings to compensate for the erratic node-energy.
- Act III — Ch. 34 (The Final Flight): Sorra provides the Traveler with the "Veil-Key"—a device that can temporarily stabilize a path through the higher reaches of the Veil—allowing the Traveler to reach the Hollow’s core.

The air on the Starward Climb was so thin it felt like drinking cold water, and the sky was a deep, velvet black, filled with a billion shimmering stars. The Traveler was struggling to maintain their balance on a narrow ledge when a soft *hum-whirr* sound drifted over the peak. A figure appeared, descending from the sky on wings of light and glass, landing gracefully a few feet away.

"You're a long way from the ground, Traveler," Sorra Veil said, her wings folding back with a metallic *click*. She pushed her goggles up, her golden eyes bright with excitement. "In Alkyr, the ground is just a suggestion. The real world is up here, in the patterns and the currents." She reached into her harness and pulled out a small, glowing lens. "I have a map of a path that doesn't exist yet. Very dangerous. Very beautiful. It only costs a single memory of a sunset. Do you have one to spare? Or are you too busy holding onto the rock?"

> *Status:* Complete. Current-jitter is exceeding safety parameters.
> *Notes:* I saw a 'Static-Point' in the lattice today. A man with a compass that doesn't tick. I've given him a lens and a path. He moves like he's already part of the sky. I'll follow him for a while. If he reaches the Hollow, I want to be the one who sees it first.

"The sky isn't a ceiling; it's a map. And I'm the one who knows how to read it."
"Don't look down, Traveler. The ground is just a memory of where you used to be."
"Every path has a price. And the price of the sky is your heart."

Sorra begins as a carefree and somewhat reckless explorer, viewing the world's decay as just another adventure. Through her interactions with the Traveler and her own observations of the node-collapse, she realizes that her "exploration" is actually a race against time. She moves from being a "scout of the sky" to a "guide for the future," eventually choosing to use her aether-wings to provide the Traveler with the "Sonic-Key" needed to reach the Hollow's core.

### Supplemental Lore: The Aether-Wings of Alkyr

In the high peaks of Alkyr, the atmosphere is so thin and the Meridian Veil is so close that the laws of gravity begin to blur with the laws of resonance. The "Aether-Wings" are devices created by the Veil-Scouts to navigate this environment.

These wings are not physical in the traditional sense; they are "Resonant-Levitators" that use the energy of the local nodes to generate lift and propulsion. By adjusting the angle and frequency of the glass plates, a skilled scout can "ride" the aether-currents like a bird on the wind. However, the process is extremely taxing on the user's mind and body. Constant use of the wings can lead to "Aether-Sickness," a condition where the user's own internal resonance becomes detached from the physical world, leading to hallucinations, memory loss, and a frantic, obsessive need to keep moving.

### The Aether-Lens of Sorra

Sorra’s lens is more than a tool; it is a "Metaphysical Filter."

1. **The Glass-Plates:** Each plate is etched with a different node-sigil, allowing the user to see different levels of the Veil.
2. **The Copper-Wires:** Used to "anchor" Sorra's consciousness to the wings while she is flying.

### Fragment from a Scout's Diary

> He didn't blink when the currents took him. Most people panic. They try to grab onto anything solid, to prove they're still real. He just nodded and followed. He is a man who is already comfortable with the dark. I've given him the Veil-Key. It's the only thing that can protect him from the 'Scream' of the Hollow. I'll stay here, in the sky. I'll make sure the Absence doesn't follow him.
