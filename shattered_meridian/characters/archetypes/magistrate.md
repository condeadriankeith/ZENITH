# Archetype: The Magistrate (Cyris)

## Appearance
- **Clothing:** Stiff, white-chalked robes with embroidered ledger-lines.
- **Tools:** A portable marble stylus and a small vial of "Oathtaker's Ink."
- **Markings:** Inked thumbprints on the palms, representing years of adjudicating bindings.

## Speech Samples
- "By the Pillar of Oaths, this contract is binding."
- "The ledger does not forget, even if you do."
- "Show me your thumb-mark; let the Meridian witness your intent."

## Signature Magic
- **Covenant Magic:** Creating white fissure lines that physically bind two parties to an agreement.
- **Cost:** Magistrates often lose the ability to dream of anything other than law and order.

## Moral Contradictions
- They value stability above all else, yet their rigid enforcement often causes the very social friction they seek to prevent.
- They serve the Binder's pattern, but they are often forced to use left-hand "emergency" rites to prevent node collapses.

## Arc Beats
1. **The Strict Adherent:** Enforcing a minor law that has devastating human consequences.
2. **The Doubt:** Witnessing a node failure that the law cannot fix.
3. **The Compromise:** Using an unsanctioned rite to save a community.
