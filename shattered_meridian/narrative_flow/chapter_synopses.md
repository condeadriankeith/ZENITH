## Part I: The Weight of Names

### Chapter 1: The Weight of the Lullaby
**Logline:** Born into a nameless valley and raised on a lullaby, the Traveler makes his first forbidden bargain to save a friend, only to lose his name and his home in the process.

**Synopsis:**
The Traveler is born into a nameless valley on the edge of the Valen crossroads, his arrival marked by the reedy hum of a Name-Bleed omen. His naming ritual is temporary, leaving his identity fluid and vulnerable to the Meridian's pull. His mother’s lullaby becomes his primary anchor, a song of binding that keeps the creeping memory-loss of the Quarantine at bay.

As a child, he experiences the first terrifying slip of memory—a verse of the lullaby vanishing into the ether. This loss fuels a dangerous curiosity. By adolescence, he is experimenting with the "left-hand" path, using inverted gestures to coax small miracles from the local flora. These acts draw the suspicion of the village elders, who recognize the signs of unsanctioned magic.

The turning point comes when a "Name-Fever" strikes his childhood friend, Kael. Desperate and reckless, the Traveler uses his mother’s lullaby as a component in a powerful, inverted binding to save the boy. He succeeds, but the cost is absolute: the village forgets the Traveler’s name, and he is erased from their collective memory. He leaves his home a ghost, carrying only a torn scrap of the lullaby and a burning need to understand the laws that broke his world. His journey begins with a chance meeting with an Archivist, who trades him a ledger fragment and a clue to the Hollow, setting him on the path to the ruined center of the world.
