# Lore Update Summary: Shattered Meridian Overhaul

## 1. Executive Summary
This update implements a comprehensive "Cosmic Lore" layer to the *Shattered Meridian* worldbuilding. It transitions the project from a standard fantasy setting to a high-concept metaphysical world governed by the **Meridian Lattice**, the **Spirit Mirror**, and the **Quarantine**.

## 2. Key Changes
### A. Metaphysics & Systems
- **The Meridian Lattice:** Established the world's physical skeleton as a network of Nodes and Cores.
- **Spirit Mirror & Name-Bleed:** Defined the sensory consequences of metaphysical instability. "Names" are now a tangible resource/currency.
- **Spirit Resonance (SR):** Introduced a technical measure for mortal alignment with the Spirit Mirror.
- **Quarantine Response:** Defined the automated defense system (Toll, Net, Pruning).

### B. World Lore
- **Edict of Names:** Formalized the refrain "Mortals should not meddle with the power of the Gods" as a fundamental world-law.
- **The Architects:** Clarified their role as system managers (Celestials) who left behind "Residual Authority."
- **The Fracture (907 R):** Solidified the canonical origin event involving the Arc-Foundry of Virek.

### C. Character & Narrative
- **Traveler Integration:** Linked the Traveler's left-hand scar and his mother's lullaby to the "Checksum" logic of the Lattice.
- **Archive Update:** Added 3 new journal fragments referencing the Mirror, Edict, and Checksum Trade (signed "— Maer").
- **Prologue Revision:** Provided an annotated version of the Prologue and direct prose patches for stronger lore integration.

## 3. Compliance & Cleanup
- **Forbidden Terms:** Removed all instances of "runic" (replaced with arc/glyph/sigil) and ensured no LoL/Runeterra terms remain.
- **Canonical Preservation:** Verified all 6 non-negotiable canonical strings are present and verbatim.
- **Exposition Policy:** Ensured all new lore is presented via in-universe artifacts or concise framing.

## 4. Next Steps for Authors
1. Review the [Prologue Patch Suggestions](file:///c:/Users/conde/Downloads/shatteredMeridian_novel_draft/shattered_meridian/editorial/prologue_patch_suggestions.md) to integrate new logic into Chapter 1.
2. Use the [Annotated Prologue](file:///c:/Users/conde/Downloads/shatteredMeridian_novel_draft/shattered_meridian/scenes/00_prologue_lore_annotated.md) as a sensory guide for future scenes.
3. Reference the [Systems Arcana](file:///c:/Users/conde/Downloads/shatteredMeridian_novel_draft/shattered_meridian/systems/systems_arcana.md) for SR thresholds when describing magic use.
