## Scene 1.1 — Birth (wide → close)
- **Setting:** A nameless valley village under the cultural influence of Valen/Cyris.
- **POV:** Third-person cinematic (focus on the environment and the newborn).
- **Conflict:** The fragility of existence in a world of Meridian instability.
- **Beats:**
  - **Wide:** The valley at dusk; the village huddles around a communal well.
  - **Medium:** Inside a modest cottage; the midwife prepares ink and bone.
  - **Close:** The mother in labor; the wet earth floor and herbal steam.
  - **The Omen:** As the child is born, the village well begins to hum a steady, reedy tone—the first hint of Name-Bleed.
  - **The Ritual:** A temporary naming ritual is performed; a ledger-bone is offered.
  - **Outcome:** The child is born; the mother hums a lullaby that will become his first anchor.
- **Worldbuilding Hook:** Village naming customs, the reedy hum of Name-Bleed.
