# The Shattered Meridian

An epic fantasy worldbuilding compendium featuring systems-minded magic with human consequences. The world once tuned by meta-agents called Architects is now bereft of direct divine governance after a catastrophic experiment triggered a planetary quarantine: The Meridian Quarantine.

## Core Premise
Mortals are taught the refrain, *"Mortals should not meddle with the power of the Gods"* to prevent catastrophic meddling. The Traveler — nameless, left-handed, carrying a pack of forbidden knowledge and a personal debt — discovers he can break the social law and the mechanical locks. His moral choices will either heal, replace, or doom the world.

## Key Elements
- **Prismatic imagery** and **left-hand motifs** throughout
- **Systems-minded magic** with technical consequences
- **Repeating sensory Ruination** (Name-Bleed)
- Complex political dynamics among institutions
