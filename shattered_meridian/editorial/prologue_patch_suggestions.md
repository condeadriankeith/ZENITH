# Prologue Patch Suggestions: Spirit Mirror & Meridian Integration

This document provides concrete suggestions for integrating the new Cosmic Lore directly into the Prologue prose. Authors can choose between using the **Annotated Version** (already provided in `scenes/00_prologue_lore_annotated.md`) or applying these **Direct Patches**.

## Option 1: Direct Prose Patches (Insertion Lines)

If you wish to weave the new metaphysics directly into the narrative, consider inserting the following paragraphs at the indicated locations in `scenes/00_prologue_draft.md`.

### Patch A: The Spirit Mirror's Presence
**Insert after paragraph 1 ("The air tasted of copper..."):**
> The atmosphere was thick with the Spirit Mirror's bleed, a prismatic oil-slick that ghosted behind his every movement. He could see the definition-lines of the ruined pillars flickering, as if the world were struggling to remember the shape of stone.

### Patch B: The Checksum Logic
**Insert after paragraph 5 ("He put his palm to the binding..."):**
> He reached into the "Identity-Vacuum" where his name, Maer, had once lived. He pulled instead upon the lullaby—that fragment of Original Definition the Architects had left behind. It was a checksum the Meridian Lattice could not ignore, a frequency older than the Quarantine itself.

### Patch C: The Core Interaction
**Insert after paragraph 7 ("The surge was not painless..."):**
> For a heartbeat, his Spirit Resonance spiked into the red. The reedy hum of the well became a roar in his marrow, and the metallic tang on his tongue turned to the taste of raw lightning. He wasn't just touching a book; he was pulling a Primal Thread from the node's very Core.

## Option 2: The "Light Touch" (Annotations Only)

If you prefer to keep the Prologue prose as-is to preserve its mystery, use `scenes/00_prologue_lore_annotated.md` as your guide. This version keeps the text verbatim but provides the metaphysical "why" for each sensory detail, allowing readers (and future editors) to understand the underlying mechanics without explicit exposition.

## Recommendation

For the strongest thematic cohesion, we recommend applying **Patch B** and **Patch C**. These provide the necessary bridge between the Traveler's personal loss (the lullaby) and the global mechanics of the Meridian Lattice, making the scene feel like a high-stakes technical bypass rather than a standard magical interaction.
