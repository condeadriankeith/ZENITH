## The Fracture — Full Account (canonical)

> In the year 907 of the Reckoning, the Treaty of Three Stones convened its engineers, ritualists, and archivists upon a crossing of leylines in the Central Plain. The Arc-Foundry's Mercury-Keel prototype, designed to "phase" a node for temporal observations, was calibrated to a new range. That night the node sang not a local song but an old pattern—an Architect-signature. The Quarantine awoke in a way that had not happened for an age. Locks spread like a cold net, sealing nodes, cutting flows, and severing Architects from their Mortal work. The world felt like a house whose doors had been slammed suddenly. What men called the Vanishing is the echo of that slam. Cities changed, treaties collapsed, and the Meridian became a guarded thing. The Hollow's Seal was keyed that night.

## The Hollow Chronicle (excerpt / full)

> The Hollow was never the shrine of a single Aspect. The altar sits upon a triune helix of runes that, when whole, would have permitted careful bridging among Cyclewright and Binder currents. The Book that floats there was created by an anonymous archivist who sought synthesis: a manual to reconcile law with living memory and with the mechanical schematics of inventors. They stitched methods together and then wrote a final line across the binding: *"We stitched what we could not pay for."* When the Fracture's Lock tripped, the Book became quarantine-chamber and key. It holds patterns both to re-tune a node and to burn it clean. How that can be both cure and contagion is the core caution written into the Hollow's architecture.

## The First False Ascension (Sahru) — full

> The city of Zur-Sahru crowned King Haraes in 968 R. Haraes felt the itch of legend: to sit among Ascended Kings whose names were carved into the sun-washed steps of history. In 972 R he obtained stolen components: a Pillar-slate from Cyris, a star-shard from Alkyr's black market, and a living tongue from a Thalen grove. He attempted Ascension alone, believing the gods undone and that mortal will could take the mantle. The ritual failed. Flesh brightened to glass; the tide of names left the ground in a breath. The surrounding ten miles lost permanent naming: infants could not keep given names; words slid off tongues. King Haraes became a revenant — something that remembered himself only as hunger for names. The Black Sands were born; a warning that would remain for generations in children's rhymes.

## The Treaty of Three Stones — Canonical text (excerpt)

> *Signed, Year 102 R, on the Central Plain.*
> Representatives from Cyris, Virek, and Thalen hereby agree to joint stewardship of the Crossing Node. We acknowledge that no single polity shall monopolize node access. A rotating Codex Tribunal shall adjudicate access under the terms of binding — and all parties shall maintain a ledger of activity to be stored in triplicate.

## The Cyclewright's Silence

> In the Age of Weft, the Cyclewright maintained the turning of seasons with gentle precision. When the Architects withdrew during the Fracture, the people of the Verdant Confluence (Thalen) felt the first tremor: their groves began to bloom and wither in the same breath. The seasonal rhythms that had been steady as heartbeat became erratic as fever dreams. This marked the beginning of the world's unraveling, though few recognized it as such at the time.

## The Binder's Oath

> The Codex Courts of Cyris recorded that before the Vanishing, oaths carried a different weight. They were not merely social contracts but physical bindings etched into the Meridian itself. When the Architects departed, these bonds weakened, leaving society to rely on increasingly complex legal frameworks to maintain the social order that had once been supported by metaphysical certainty.

## The Forger's Legacy

> Virek's great innovation period ended abruptly with the Fracture. The engineers who had been learning to harmonize their machines with Architect patterns suddenly found themselves in a world where such harmony was not only impossible but dangerous. The Mercury-Keel prototype that caused the Fracture was intended as a culmination of this work—a bridge between mortal ingenuity and divine architecture.

## The Deep-Mother's Memory

> In Kallum, the tide-ledgers served as repositories of collective memory. When the Deep-Mother's connection to the world was severed during the Vanishing, the ledgers began to forget. Names once carefully preserved in bone and salt started to fade. The people of Kallum developed new techniques for memory preservation, but the loss of the Architects' direct involvement meant that names could truly be lost forever.

## The Shroud's Rest

> The Shroud aspect had maintained the natural order of endings—death, decay, and renewal. When it withdrew during the Fracture, the world experienced a peculiar imbalance: some things that should end persisted unnaturally, while others vanished before their time. This disruption contributed to the growing sense of instability that characterized the Age of Tension.

## The White Hand's Emergence

> The White Hand cult emerged in the decades following the Fracture as a response to the new limitations placed on mortal agency. Believing that the Architects' departure had created an opportunity for mortals to claim divine power, they developed techniques for left-hand rites and unauthorized ascension attempts. Their practices were deemed heretical by most established institutions.

## The Archivum Noctis Formation

> Founded during the Age of Edifice, the Archivum Noctis initially served as a repository for knowledge that was deemed too dangerous for general circulation. After the Fracture, their mission evolved to include the preservation of pre-Vanishing knowledge and the documentation of the changing world. Their archives remain among the most comprehensive records of the transition period.

## The Great Sealing Timeline

> Between 1300 and 1315 R, a coordinated effort sealed most high-order access points to the Meridian. This period saw the systematic deactivation of major nodes and the establishment of new quarantine protocols. The Great Sealing represented a collective decision to prioritize stability over advancement, accepting the limitations of the post-Architect world.

## The Era of Rediscovery

> Beginning in 1601 R, a new generation of scholars and practitioners began to rediscover and reinterpret the old techniques. This era has seen cautious experimentation with Meridian access, often leading to encounters with the Traveler and renewed awareness of the world's underlying metaphysical structures.

## Name-Bleed Phenomenon

> In places afflicted by quarantine the air takes on a metallic tang, and wells hum a steady, reedy tone. Names leak like blood from a wound — at first a single proper name, then strange lapses: the bread's name slips away, the map forgets the river. When a name dies in a town a small bell somewhere tolls once, low and threadbare. People look at one another and find their mouths empty of memory.

## The Traveler's Arrival

> Accounts of the Traveler's appearance vary, but all agree on certain consistent elements: a left-handed figure carrying a pack of knowledge, bearing the scars of bargains, and demonstrating unusual resilience to the usual consequences of Meridian interaction. The timing of the Traveler's emergence coincides with signs of awakening in long-dormant nodes.

## Regional Adaptations Post-Fracture

> Each region developed distinct approaches to maintaining social order and practical magic after the Fracture. Cyris emphasized legal frameworks, Thalen focused on ecological partnerships, Virek pursued technological solutions, and other regions developed their own adaptations. These differences continue to influence inter-regional relations and cultural values.

## The Hollow's Significance

> The Hollow represents both the greatest achievement and the greatest caution of the pre-Fracture age. The anonymous archivist who created the floating Book sought to synthesize all approaches to the Meridian, but the attempt proved too ambitious. The resulting quarantine serves as a monument to the dangers of overreaching ambition in matters of cosmic significance.

## Institutions in Transition

> Established institutions like the Codex Courts, Verdant Cirri, Arc-Foundry, and Tide-Ledger Houses all faced existential challenges during and after the Fracture. Those that survived did so by adapting their purposes and methods to the new reality, though tensions between traditional and adapted approaches persist.

## Magic's Evolution

> The relationship between mortals and the Meridian has continued to evolve since the Fracture. While the fundamental laws remain unchanged, practitioners have developed new techniques and workarounds. The emergence of composite, prismatic approaches represents a significant evolution in magical theory and practice.

## The Promise of Restoration

> Various theories exist about the possibility of restoring the pre-Fracture relationship with the Architects. Some believe the Traveler represents a path toward restoration, others see the current state as permanent, and still others advocate for a new form of divine-mortal relationship. These competing visions drive much of the contemporary conflict in the world.
