# Myth: The Celestial Fable

> "Once, before the world was broken, the Celestials held a great feast. They invited the first mortals to sit at their table and listen to the song of the stars. But the mortals were greedy; they didn't just want to listen, they wanted to sing. One mortal, a man with a voice like a silver bell, tried to harmonize with the Great Shaper. But a mortal's voice is made of breath and bone, while a Celestial's voice is made of light and law. When the man sang, the song of the stars cracked. The Celestials didn't get angry; they simply stopped singing. And in that silence, the world began to forget. That is why we give our children names: so the silence doesn't find them."

## Commentary
This fable illustrates the cultural shift from the "Direct Rule" of the Celestial Age to the "Silence" of the Modern Era. It frames Name-Bleed as a consequence of mortal hubris—not an act of punishment, but a natural result of trying to "harmonize" with powers beyond mortal capacity.
