# 03 — The Fracture: An Eyewitness Account

> In the year 907 of the Reckoning, the Treaty of Three Stones convened its engineers, ritualists, and archivists upon a crossing of leylines in the Central Plain. The Arc-Foundry’s Mercury-Keel prototype, designed to “phase” a node for temporal observations, was calibrated to a new range. That night the node sang not a local song but an old pattern—an Architect-signature. The Quarantine awoke in a way that had not happened for an age. Locks spread like a cold net, sealing nodes, cutting flows, and severing Architects from their Mortal work. The world felt like a house whose doors had been slammed suddenly. What men called the Vanishing is the echo of that slam. Cities changed, treaties collapsed, and the Meridian became a guarded thing. The Hollow’s Seal was keyed that night.

This account was recovered from a burnt ledger near the site of the original crossing. It remains the most accurate description of the event that redefined our world.
