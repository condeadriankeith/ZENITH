# 04 — The Sensory Toll of Name-Bleed

> In places afflicted by quarantine the air takes on a metallic tang, and wells hum a steady, reedy tone. Names leak like blood from a wound — at first a single proper name, then strange lapses: the bread’s name slips away, the map forgets the river. When a name dies in a town a small bell somewhere tolls once, low and threadbare. People look at one another and find their mouths empty of memory.

This phenomenon, known as Name-Bleed, is the first sign of a local node failure. It is the sensory manifestation of the Meridian Quarantine attempting to "prune" high-entropy data from the local environment.
