# The Fracture (907 R)

> In the year 907 of the Reckoning, the Treaty of Three Stones convened its engineers, ritualists, and archivists upon a crossing of leylines in the Central Plain. The Arc-Foundry's Mercury-Keel prototype, designed to "phase" a node for temporal observations, was calibrated to a new range. That night the node sang not a local song but an old pattern—an Architect-signature. The Quarantine awoke in a way that had not happened for an age. Locks spread like a cold net, sealing nodes, cutting flows, and severing Architects from their Mortal work. The world felt like a house whose doors had been slammed suddenly. What men called the Vanishing is the echo of that slam. Cities changed, treaties collapsed, and the Meridian became a guarded thing. The Hollow's Seal was keyed that night.

## Context and Causes

The Fracture of 907 R stands as the pivotal moment that reshaped the world of the Shattered Meridian. Occurring during the height of the Age of Edifice, when cities had institutionalized arcana and guilds flourished, the event marked the end of the era of direct Architect involvement in mortal affairs.

The incident originated from a collaborative effort between Cyris, Virek, and Thalen under the Treaty of Three Stones, which had been established in 102 R to manage the largest cross-continental node. Renowned for their expertise in arc-engineering, the Arc-Foundry of Virek had developed the Mercury-Keel prototype as a means to observe temporal phenomena at the node level.

## The Experiment

The Mercury-Keel was designed to "phase" a node temporally, allowing researchers to observe how leyline flows operated across different time periods. The device itself was a marvel of technomancy, combining Virek's engineering prowess with theoretical frameworks developed through the collaborative efforts of all three founding nations.

However, when the prototype was calibrated to its new operational range during the fateful night of the Fracture, it resonated with patterns far older than anyone anticipated. The node began to sing with an Architect-signature, awakening dormant protocols that had been encoded into the Meridian Veil itself.

## The Awakening of the Quarantine

The Meridian Quarantine, a distributed defense network composed of activated Meridian Locks and residual Architect-logic, responded to this resonance with immediate and overwhelming force. Network-wide activation protocols engaged, spreading Locks like a "cold net" across the world's metaphysical infrastructure.

This activation was not random but precisely targeted. The Quarantine's purpose was to preserve the structural coherence of the Meridian Veil at any cost, and the unexpected activation of ancient Architect-patterns represented a severe threat to that coherence.

## Consequences

The immediate effects were devastating:

- **Sealing of nodes:** Critical infrastructure for magic use was rendered inaccessible
- **Cutting of flows:** Leyline connections that had sustained regional stability were severed
- **Severing of Architect connection:** Direct interaction between the Architects and the Mortal Face was terminated

The metaphor of "doors being slammed" captures the suddenness and completeness of the separation. What mortals had interpreted as the "Vanishing" was, in fact, the Quarantine's protective response to what it perceived as a catastrophic threat to the world's metaphysical structure.

## Long-term Impact

The Fracture fundamentally altered the relationship between mortals and the Meridian. Magic, which had previously been guided by Architect oversight, became a more dangerous and unpredictable force. The Three Laws of Ascension gained prominence as enforceable cosmic principles rather than mere guidelines.

Regional powers that had relied on stable node access found themselves isolated. The Treaty of Three Stones, which had been the cornerstone of international cooperation, collapsed along with the node it was designed to manage.

## The Hollow's Connection

Significantly, the Fracture resulted in the keying of the Hollow's Seal, establishing the ruined site as a focal point for quarantine measures. The anonymous archivist who would later create the floating Book was likely responding to the new realities established by the Fracture, attempting to synthesize approaches that could work within the Quarantine's constraints.

## Historical Analysis

Modern scholars view the Fracture as both tragedy and necessity. While it ended an era of unprecedented cooperation and magical advancement, it may have prevented a catastrophic collapse of the world's metaphysical structure. The Mercury-Keel experiment, though disastrous, revealed the extent to which the Architects had embedded protective measures in the Meridian itself.

The event established the template for all future interactions with the Meridian: respect for its fundamental laws, awareness of the Quarantine's presence, and the understanding that certain forms of power come with irreversible costs.
