# Artifact: Hollow Field Notes

> "The air here tastes of copper and things I should have said to my father. The well hums a B-flat that makes my teeth ache. I tried to write my name in the dust, but the dust wouldn't hold the shape. **'We stitched what we could not pay for.'** That's what the last Archivist told me before the silence took them. We thought we were building a world, but we were just borrowing the Architects' needles."

## Archivist Note
The phrase "We stitched what we could not pay for" refers to the Age of Edifice, when mortals used arcane residue to build vast civilizations without fully understanding the "Debt" they were accruing. The "Hollow" is the physical manifestation of that debt being called in.
