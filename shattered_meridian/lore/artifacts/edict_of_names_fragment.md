# Artifact: The Edict of Names Fragment

> "And the Great Shaper looked upon the Unbound and saw that it was without form. And the Shaper spoke the first word, and the world began to vibrate. And the Shaper said, 'Let the mountain be called *Akal*, and let its frequency be firm.' And it was so. And the Shaper said, 'Let the mortal be called *Guest*, and let them walk upon the threads, but let them not pull the threads, for the threads are the life of the world.' And the Shaper inscribed upon the stone the final warning: **'Mortals should not meddle with the power of the Gods.'**"

## Archivist Note
This fragment is one of the few surviving direct accounts of the "First Ordering." The language is archaic, but the intent is clear: the Architects viewed the world as a delicate instrument of sound and light. The "Meddling" mentioned in the refrain is not just a warning against pride, but a warning against "un-tuning" the world's fundamental frequency.
