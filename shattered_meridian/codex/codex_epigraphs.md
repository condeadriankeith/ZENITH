## From the Treaty of Three Stones (102 R)

> *Signed, Year 102 R, on the Central Plain.*
> Representatives from Cyris, Virek, and Thalen hereby agree to joint stewardship of the Crossing Node. We acknowledge that no single polity shall monopolize node access. A rotating Codex Tribunal shall adjudicate access under the terms of binding — and all parties shall maintain a ledger of activity to be stored in triplicate.

## From Codex Courts, Fracture Dossier

> The world felt like a house whose doors had been slammed suddenly. What men called the Vanishing is the echo of that slam.

## Children's Rhyme from Cyris

> When the Locks wake and the Nodes seal,
> Remember the price that mortals feel.
> The Veil remembers what we forgot,
> And the Refrain keeps us unbought.

## Verse from Thalen Groves

> Names grow like rings in living bark,
> But cut too deep and silence marks.
> The memory fades, the voice turns thin,
> Where no true name remembers kin.

## Engineer's Admonition from Virek

> Schematics drawn in brass and steel
> May crack the foundations we rely.
> The Keel that cuts through temporal field
> May sunder what we cannot tie.

## Tide-Ledger Saying from Kallum

> Salt preserves what water takes,
> But ledgers hold what memory breaks.
> A name once spent can't be refunded,
> By any tide that's ever bounded.

## Oathkeeper's Maxim from Eirn

> Ice preserves what stone forgets,
> And oaths endure what fire lets.
> Carved in frost, the promise stays,
> Until the breaker pays the ways.

## Alkyr Pilgrim's Prayer

> Stars above, echoes below,
> Between the two, our true names go.
> Listen well to Meridian winds,
> Where Veil and Face both meet and blend.

## Mirel Mist-Seller's Chant

> In mists we hide what echoes know,
> The names we've lost and names we've sown.
> Veil whispers secrets to the shore,
> Where memory and mist both pour.

## Nyth Researcher's Warning

> In spaces thin where logic bends,
> The self may lose what being sends.
> Question not what "I" may mean,
> In places where no names are seen.

## Valen Trader's Wisdom

> Crossroads meet where paths align,
> But nodes that break affect all signs.
> Safe passage comes to those who pay
> The toll of keeping common way.

## White Hand Proclamation

> Why should mortals bow to Locks?
> Our will is strong, our courage stocks.
> If Gods have left, then we'll take lead,
> Though Quarantine tries to impede.

## Archivum Noctis Mandate

> Truth preserved in shadow's care,
> Keeps balance between hope and despair.
> What's hidden may protect or harm,
> So choose to guard or to disarm.

## Cyclewright's Seasonal Chant

> Growth and harvest, death and birth,
> The wheel turns on this sacred earth.
> When Architects withdrew their hands,
> The seasons learned to walk on lands.

## Binder's Legal Formula

> Words once spoken, deeds once done,
> Are etched in Meridian, never gone.
> Contracts bind both flesh and soul,
> When Codex Courts render their goal.

## Forger's Innovation Creed

> Progress built on knowledge's base,
> Must respect the power's grace.
> New designs from old parts made,
> Should honor debts that must be paid.

## Deep-Mother's Lament

> Names and memories held in deep,
> Where ocean's memory runs so steep.
> When tides retreat and voices fade,
> The lost names make the surface frayed.

## Shroud's Final Whisper

> Sleep and silence, rest and peace,
> Some things should from sight decrease.
> Not all that's hidden should be known,
> Some mysteries should stand alone.
