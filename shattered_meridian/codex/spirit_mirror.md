# The Spirit Mirror: The Reflection of Reality

> "Look into the water of the well and you will see the world as it truly is: a shimmer of names waiting to be forgotten."
> — *Folklore of the Central Plain*

## Definition of the Spirit Mirror
The Spirit Mirror is the energetic substrate of the physical world. It is the "inner face" of the Meridian Lattice, where every object, creature, and location exists as a unique frequency or "name." While the Mortal Face is composed of matter, the Spirit Mirror is composed of meaning.

## The Bleeding Effect
When the structural integrity of a node is compromised, the boundary between the Mortal Face and the Spirit Mirror begins to fail. This is the "Bleeding."
- **Visuals:** The air takes on a prismatic, oily sheen; light seems to "lag" or "ghost" behind moving objects.
- **Sensory:** A metallic tang on the tongue and a low, reedy hum that resonates in the bones.

## Name-Bleed and the Mirror
Name-Bleed occurs when the "meaning" of an object in the Spirit Mirror is consumed by the Quarantine. Without its reflection in the Mirror, the physical object in the Mortal Face begins to lose its definition. A chair might still be there, but the *concept* of "chairness" is gone, making it impossible for people to remember what it is or how to use it.

## Cultural Beliefs
- **Islanders:** Believe the Spirit Mirror is the "Ancestral Breath" and that Name-Bleed is the world literally exhaling its history.
- **Virek Engineers:** View the Mirror as a "debug layer" that has become corrupted, requiring "arc-patches" to stabilize.
- **Thalen Shapers:** Treat the Mirror as a garden that must be tended to prevent the "weeds" of entropy from choking out the names of the trees.

## Interaction with the Traveler
The Traveler possesses a unique sensitivity to the Spirit Mirror. He can "hear" the frequencies of the names that are being lost and can sometimes "catch" a fragment of a name as it bleeds away, storing it in his ledger or his memory. This makes him both a savior and a scavenger in the eyes of the world.
