# Cosmic Lore: The Primal State and the Architects

## The First State
In the beginning, the world existed in a state of fluid potential. There were no boundaries between spirit and matter, no names to anchor concepts, and no laws to govern the flow of energy. This was the era of the Unbound, a time of infinite possibility and absolute chaos.

## The Architects (Celestials)
The Architects—often referred to in islander myth as the Celestials—descended into this chaos to provide definition. They did not create the world, but they *ordered* it. Through the Edict of Names, they assigned a specific frequency to every object, creature, and concept. This process of naming was the first act of binding, transforming the Unbound into the Meridian.

## Arcane as Residual Authority
What mortals now call "arcane" is actually the residual authority of the Architects. It is the leftover power from the First Ordering, a set of administrative privileges that allow for the manipulation of the world's underlying structure. Because this power is tied to the original act of naming, it responds most strongly to names, memories, and acts of sacrifice.

## The Meridian Lattice
The Meridian is the metaphysical skeleton of the world. It is a vast, invisible lattice of energy that connects all named things. Every node is a junction where these threads of reality cross, and every leyline is a conduit for the information that maintains the world's consistency.

## The Veil and the Spirit Mirror
The Veil is the boundary between the Mortal Face (the physical world) and the Spirit Mirror (the energetic reflection). The Spirit Mirror is not a separate place, but a layer of reality where the "names" of things exist as pure frequency. When the Meridian is healthy, the Veil is thin but firm. When Name-Bleed occurs, the Spirit Mirror begins to leak into the Mortal Face, causing the physical world to lose its definition.

## The Quarantine
Following the Fracture of 907 R, the Meridian's automated defense protocols—the Quarantine—engaged. This system views any unsanctioned use of Architect-level power as a breach. The Quarantine does not judge; it simply corrects, often by "pruning" the names and memories associated with the breach to prevent the corruption from spreading through the lattice.
