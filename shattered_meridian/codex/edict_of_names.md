# The Edict of Names: Law, Myth, and Propaganda

> "Mortals should not meddle with the power of the Gods."
> — *The First Refrain, inscribed upon the Gates of Cyris*

## The Historical Edict
The Edict of Names was the foundational law established by the Architects at the end of the Age of Creation. It decreed that only those with "Original Definition" could command the Meridian Lattice. For mortals, the Edict functioned as a boundary: they were permitted to live within the ordered world but were forbidden from altering its fundamental patterns.

## The Refrain as World-Law
The phrase **“Mortals should not meddle with the power of the Gods”** is more than a religious commandment; it is a description of a physical constraint. The "power of the Gods" refers to the ability to rename or redefine reality. When a mortal attempts to do so, the Meridian's own structural integrity is threatened, triggering the Quarantine.

## Evolution into Propaganda
In the Modern Fracture Age, the Edict has been co-opted by various political entities, most notably the Codex Courts of Cyris. They use the refrain to justify their monopoly on "sanctioned" arcana. By framing the physical laws of the Meridian as moral laws, they maintain control over who is allowed to access the nodes and what "costs" are considered acceptable.

## Cultural Impact
Across the Shattered Meridian, the Edict has shaped naming customs. In many cultures, names are considered a form of currency or a loan from the world itself. To lose one's name is not just a personal tragedy, but a legal and spiritual "eviction" from the ordered world.

## The Debt Logic
The Edict established that any interaction with the Meridian is a transaction. Because mortals are not the "owners" of the world's Definition, any energy they draw from the Lattice is considered a debt. This debt must be paid in the same currency the Architects used to build the world: the substance of memory and identity.
