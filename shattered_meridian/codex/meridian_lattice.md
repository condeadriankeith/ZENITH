# The Meridian Lattice: Structure and Function

## The Lattice Overview
The Meridian Lattice is the procedural framework of reality. It is a network of energetic threads that carry the "Definition" provided by the Architects. Every object in the Mortal Face is anchored by a corresponding thread in the Lattice.

## Nodes and Cores
- **Nodes:** These are the primary intersections of the Lattice. They act as local processing hubs for reality, maintaining the consistency of the physical world within their radius.
- **Cores (Primal Threads):** At the center of every major node is a Core—a bundle of high-frequency threads that connect directly to the deeper layers of the Meridian. Accessing a Core allows for significant changes to the local reality but requires a massive "checksum" (usually a name or a significant memory).

## Meridian Locks
Locks are security protocols established during the Edict Era and activated during the Fracture. They are designed to "quarantine" nodes that exhibit high entropy or unauthorized access. A Locked node becomes a "Hollow," where the flow of energy is restricted and the local reality begins to stagnate or dissolve.

## The Checksum Logic
The Meridian operates on a logic of exchange. To access a node's power, a mortal must provide a "signature" that the Lattice recognizes. In the modern age, since mortals no longer possess the original Architect-codes, they must trade pieces of their own identity—their names and memories—to "pay" for the energy they use.

## Quarantine Behavior
When a node is compromised, the Quarantine spreads like a cold net through the surrounding Lattice. It severs the connections between the compromised node and the rest of the network, preventing "Definition-loss" from spreading. This results in the phenomenon known as Name-Bleed in the physical world.
