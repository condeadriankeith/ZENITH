# Cosmic Ages: A History of the Meridian

> "Time is a circle, but the Meridian is a spiral, winding tighter with every name we lose."
> — *Ancient Alkyr Proverb*

## I. Age of Creation (The Definition)
The era when the Architects descended and established the Edict of Names.
- **The First Ordering:** The Unbound is transformed into the Meridian Lattice.
- **The Raising of Alkyr:** The first "command center" for the Architects is established.
- **The Sealing of the Veil:** The boundary between the Mortal Face and the Spirit Mirror is finalized.

## II. The Celestial Age (The Direct Rule)
A time of harmony where the Architects directly managed the nodes and guided mortal development.
- **The Gift of the Ledger:** Mortals are taught how to record and preserve names.
- **The Construction of the Great Conduits:** Leyline networks are optimized for global stability.
- **The First Resonance:** Mortals are granted limited access to "sanctioned" arcane residue.

## III. The First Breach (The False Ascension)
The first time a mortal attempted to rewrite their own Definition without Architect approval.
- **The Sahru Incident:** King Haraes attempts to "Ascend" using a forbidden Core.
- **The Creation of the Black Sands:** The first large-scale manifestation of the Quarantine.
- **The Architects' Withdrawal:** The Celestials begin to retreat from the Mortal Face, leaving behind the automated "Quarantine" protocols.

## IV. The Edict Era (The Age of Edifice)
Mortals begin to institutionalize their use of arcane residue, forming guilds and nations based on node-access.
- **The Treaty of Three Stones (102 R):** Cyris, Virek, and Thalen agree to share the Central Plain node.
- **The Rise of the Codex Courts:** Legalism becomes the primary method for managing name-costs.
- **The Invention of the Arc-Foundry:** Technological approaches to magic begin to rival traditional shaping.

## V. The Modern Fracture Age (The Current Era)
The aftermath of the 907 R experiment that triggered the global Quarantine.
- **The Fracture (907 R):** The Mercury-Keel experiment fails, activating the global Meridian Locks.
- **The Great Vanishing:** Entire cities are lost as nodes go into permanent quarantine.
- **The Rise of the Traveler:** A nameless figure begins to traverse the world, shifting debts and seeking to reweave the broken threads.
