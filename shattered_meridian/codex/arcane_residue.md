# Arcane Residue: The Leftover Authority

## What is Arcane?
Arcane is not a natural force like gravity or magnetism. It is "residual authority"—the leftover administrative power from the Edict of Names. It is the ability to interact with the Meridian Lattice using the protocols established by the Architects.

## The Nature of Residual Power
Because it is a leftover system, arcane is:
- **Responsive to Names:** Since the world was built with names, the arcane responds most readily to linguistic and conceptual triggers.
- **Entropy-Prone:** Every time a mortal uses this residual power, it causes a small amount of "wear and tear" on the Lattice. Mortals lack the tools to "repair" the structure, leading to a slow accumulation of entropy.
- **Costly:** The Meridian Lattice requires energy to maintain its Definition. Mortals cannot provide the pure energy of the Architects, so the system "taxes" them in the form of memories and identity.

## Memory as Fuel
Memory is the highest-octane fuel for arcane interaction. A memory is a "used name"—a piece of Definition that has been lived and experienced. When a Shaper or a Mage draws on the Meridian, the Lattice consumes these lived definitions to stabilize the temporary change the mortal is trying to make.

## The Risk of "The Vanishing"
The ultimate consequence of overusing arcane residue is "The Vanishing"—a state where the local node becomes so depleted of Definition that it simply ceases to exist in the Mortal Face, becoming a permanent part of the Spirit Mirror's entropy.
