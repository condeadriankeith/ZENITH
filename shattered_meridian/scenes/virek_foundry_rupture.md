# Narrative Scene: Virek Foundry Rupture — *The Shattered Meridian*

The air in the Arc-Foundry was thick with the smell of hot brass and ozone. Kaelen, the Lead Engineer, watched the pressure gauges on the Mercury-Keel prototype with a mixture of pride and terror. 

"The bandwidth is peaking," his apprentice shouted over the roar of the steam. "We're hitting the Architect-signature!"

"Hold it!" Kaelen commanded, his hand hovering over the arc-override. "If we can phase the node now, we can see the pattern. We can fix the Fracture."

But the Meridian had other plans. 

A sudden, high-pitched reedy tone filled the chamber, drowning out the mechanical din. The brass pipes began to glow with a blinding, static white light. Kaelen felt the metallic tang on his tongue—the signature of the Quarantine.

"It's a Lock!" the apprentice screamed, but his voice was suddenly cut off as a cold net of white light spread across the Foundry walls.

The leylines snapped shut with a sound like a slammed door. The Mercury-Keel engine, deprived of its energy source, let out a final, agonizing groan before shattering into a thousand prismatic shards.

Kaelen fell to his knees, his hands covering his ears. The world had gone silent. Not the silence of a quiet room, but the heavy, airless silence of a vacuum. 

"In places afflicted by quarantine the air takes on a metallic tang, and wells hum a steady, reedy tone. Names leak like blood from a wound." Kaelen remembered the warning from the old codices, but it was too late. 

He looked at his apprentice, who was staring at his own hands in confusion. "What... what was I doing?" the boy asked, his voice hollow. "What is this place?"

The Foundry, once a hub of progress, was now a quarantine chamber. The Meridian Quarantine had responded to their meddling with a surgical strike, sealing the node and erasing the memory of the work they had spent years perfecting.

Kaelen looked at the shattered remains of the engine. He realized then that the refrain wasn't just a proverb. *“Mortals should not meddle with the power of the Gods.”* It was a mechanical reality.

The door to the Foundry was now a Meridian Lock, keyed to a frequency he no longer remembered. They were trapped in the silence of their own ambition.
