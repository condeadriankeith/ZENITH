## The Scene

He came for a name.  

The Hollow took him like a wound finding a hand. Stone ribs arched overhead, the roof gored and gone; glass-fiber dust lay across the mosaic like failed prayers. Light threaded through the cracks in slow, thin blades. The air tasted of copper. Somewhere underfoot a well sang a low, reedy note that made his teeth ache.  
> **ANNOTATION:** The "metallic tang" (copper) and "reedy hum" are sensory markers of **Name-Bleed** and a compromised node. The Hollow is a **Locked Node** experiencing high entropy.

At the nave's center the altar rose: a black tooth of stone. Above it the Book hung, not bound but assembled—rings of arcana turning in their patient orbits. The shards circled like gears and they sang in a frequency that pricked memory.  
> **ANNOTATION:** The Book is an **Artifact of the Edict Era**, likely a specialized interface for the **Meridian Core**. Its "frequency" resonates with the **Spirit Mirror**.

He walked into their music. The pack on his back sagged with things that smelled of old pages and salt—the ledger-bone, a scrap of archivist hand-writing, the thin crate where he kept one stolen line. He had no staff. He had only his left hand, pale with a faint scar, a small map of bargains.  
> **ANNOTATION:** The **Left-Handed Motif** signifies his connection to the "unnamed" and the **Spirit Mirror**. The **Ledger-Bone** is a physical record of his **Name-Debts**.

He stopped at the triune runes carved in the floor. The Meridian Lock hummed—static, wary. The hum deepened; the air tightened around his throat. He could feel the arcane answering the shape of his veins, a slow iridescence rolling under the skin.  
> **ANNOTATION:** The **Triune Runes** are the physical interface for the **Meridian Lock**. The "iridescence" is **Spirit Resonance (SR)** beginning to spike as he approaches the Core.

He put his palm to the binding. The contact was a small, absolute thing. Light braided into his arm: violet like oil, gold like burned coin. The shards chimed—notes too small to be names—and a bell tolled once, somewhere under the tiles, thin and threadbare. The well's tone rose.  
> **ANNOTATION:** The "violet oil" and "gold coin" light is the visual signature of **Residual Authority (Arcane)**. The **Toll of the Bell** is the first stage of the **Quarantine Response Sequence**.

The stones spoke, not out of malice but as fact: *"Mortals should not meddle with the power of the Gods."*  
> **ANNOTATION:** This is the **First Refrain**, the world-law established by the **Edict of Names**. The stones are not conscious; they are playing back the "Definition" encoded into the node.

He did not pull away. He had paid for parts of this before, with lullabies and village mornings. The ledger-fragment in his pack rustled, reminding him which names he had spent.  
> **ANNOTATION:** This references his **Irrecoverable Cost (Law 1)**. The "lullaby" is his **Checksum**—a piece of original frequency he uses to bypass the Lock.

The surge was not painless. Power braided through muscle and bone like water through seams. He felt a hollowing—one small word in his chest unstitched and dropped away. The price counted itself in a silence where verse had been. He tasted copper and missing things.  
> **ANNOTATION:** This is the **Core Interaction**. The "hollowing" is the **Meridian Lattice** consuming a memory-fragment to "pay" for the energy he is drawing.

He withdrew his hand with only a shard of the pattern—less than he had hoped, more than he deserved. The Book quieted but did not close. The triune runes took note; the Lock registered the exchange. Somewhere beneath the town a node would cough and remember that a mortal had touched a forbidden thread.  
> **ANNOTATION:** The **Lock registered the exchange** according to **Law 3 (Political Targeting)**. The "cough" is a permanent increase in **Node Entropy (Law 2)**.

He should have fled. Instead he folded the stolen scrap into his palm and shouldered his pack. The left-hand glow faded to an afterhum that ticked like a small clock beneath his skin. He walked back through the nave into the thin light, carrying the ache of the lullaby and the faint, dangerous knowledge that debts could be shifted, not erased.
