# Atlas Master — *The Shattered Meridian*

## Overview
The Mortal Face is divided into eleven distinct regions, each defined by its topography, signature magic, and the weight of the Meridian Locks that govern it.

---

## Cyris — *The Marble Dominion*
- **Topography:** High white cliffs, terraced cities, and marble-paved roads.
- **Climate:** Arid and bright; the sun reflects harshly off the white stone.
- **Signature Magic:** Covenant / Codex Magic (Visual: marble light, white fissure lines).
- **Daily-Life Detail:** Morning begins with the communal recitation of the Door-oath; citizens place an inked thumbprint on their threshold to renew their social contract with the city.

## Thalen — *The Verdant Confluence*
- **Topography:** Floating islands connected by living bridges, dense spirit-saturated groves.
- **Climate:** Humid and misty; the air smells of crushed sap and wet earth.
- **Signature Magic:** Spirit Magic (Visual: green-gold prismatic sap shimmer).
- **Daily-Life Detail:** Crafts are grown rather than built; a chair might take a season to "weave" itself from a living root-cluster under the guidance of a shaper.

## Virek — *The Brass Ascendancy*
- **Topography:** Industrial towers, steam-shrouded valleys, and massive arc-boilers.
- **Climate:** Perpetual autumn; the sky is often orange from foundry smoke.
- **Signature Magic:** Engineered Technomancy (Visual: brass sparks and schematic overlays).
- **Daily-Life Detail:** The city moves to a clockwork shift rhythm; engineers carry arc-patent queues, waiting for their turn to test new prototypes at the Great Foundry.

## Kallum — *The Saltbound Expanse*
- **Topography:** Jagged coasts, bone-white docks, and tidal markets that vanish at high tide.
- **Climate:** Cold, salty spray; constant winds that carry the taste of old memories.
- **Signature Magic:** Tidal / Deep Magic (Visual: oily iridescence, slow breathing waves).
- **Daily-Life Detail:** Merchants at the piers use ledger-bones to record voyages; they offer a piece of their own memory to the tide to ensure a safe return.

## Eirn — *The Frostbound Oathlands*
- **Topography:** Glacial valleys, stone halls carved into mountains, and frozen leylines.
- **Climate:** Eternal winter; the cold is metaphysical as much as physical.
- **Signature Magic:** Endurance-Sigil Magic.
- **Daily-Life Detail:** Clan members undergo "ice-breath tests," standing in the glacial winds to prove the strength of their oaths; broken promises are said to freeze the blood.

## Sahru — *The Sunken Wastes*
- **Topography:** Expanses of black sand, glass-fused ruins, and silent trade plazas.
- **Climate:** Dry, blistering heat; the wind carries the "Name-Bleed" tang.
- **Signature Magic:** None sanctioned; the region is a cautionary ruin.
- **Daily-Life Detail:** People avoid using permanent names in the ash-markets; midday is marked by a period of communal silence to avoid attracting the attention of name-hungry revenants.

## Alkyr — *The Starward Climb*
- **Topography:** Sheer vertical cliffs and shrines built into the rock face.
- **Climate:** Thin air, freezing nights, and a sky that feels dangerously close.
- **Signature Magic:** Aspect-Witness Magic.
- **Daily-Life Detail:** Pilgrims spend their lives ascending the Great Stair; small alt-shops along the route sell altitude tea and dried fruit to those seeking a glimpse of the Veil.

## Mirel — *The Shrouded Coast*
- **Topography:** Reedy marshes, mist-shrouded estuaries, and lamp-lit markets.
- **Climate:** Constant damp; the mist is thick and carries echoes of the past.
- **Signature Magic:** Memory-Echo Magic.
- **Daily-Life Detail:** Bartering is done through storytelling; one might trade a childhood memory for a week's worth of smoked eel.

## Nyth — *The Fracture Beyond*
- **Topography:** Jagged rocks and impossible geometries where the land seems to fold.
- **Climate:** Erratic; physics themselves feel thin and unreliable.
- **Signature Magic:** Anti-ontology (Visual: absence-consuming hues).
- **Daily-Life Detail:** The few researchers here practice "disbelief" chants to maintain their sense of self against the creeping conceptual erosion of the region.

## Valen — *The Central Plain*
- **Topography:** Endless golden grasslands and the Great Crossroads.
- **Climate:** Temperate and dusty; the hub of all trade.
- **Signature Magic:** Trade-Glyph Magic.
- **Daily-Life Detail:** Caravan masters gather at the inns to swap rumors and sigils, pledging their routes to the Meridian in exchange for safe passage through the node-lines.

## The Hollow
- **Topography:** A permanent rupture in reality; the site of the Great Lock.
- **Climate:** Stagnant and heavy; the air feels like it's holding its breath.
- **Signature Magic:** Quarantined Arcana.
- **Daily-Life Detail:** No one lives here. The only presence is the Hollow Book, floating above a triune helix of glyphs, guarded by a Lock that has stood since the Fracture.
