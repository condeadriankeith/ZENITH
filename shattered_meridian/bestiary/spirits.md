# Spirit Ecology — *The Shattered Meridian*

## Overview
Spirits in the Shattered Meridian are not souls of the dead, but emergent patterns within the Meridian Veil. They are the "software" of the world, often gaining consciousness when a node's entropy increases or when a Lock is triggered.

## Ecology
- **Birth:** Spirits manifest near nodes or leylines. Their form is dictated by the local regional signature (e.g., sap-like in Thalen, marble-like in Cyris).
- **Sustenance:** Most spirits consume Meridian energy. Higher-order spirits (like Hunger-Spirits) may consume more complex data, such as memories or proper names.
- **Lifespan:** A spirit exists as long as its anchor (a node, a place, or a contract) remains stable. If a node is sealed, the spirits bound to it may become aggressive or dissipate.

## Interaction Mechanics
- **Naming:** Naming a spirit can bind it or grant it stability. In Thalen, this is a core cultural practice.
- **Bargaining:** Spirits can be bargained with using the left-hand rites. This is dangerous, as a spirit's "interest" on a loan is often a piece of the bargainer's identity.
- **Warding:** Runic patterns and salt-verses can be used to ward off aggressive spirits like Oath-Wights or Frost-Wraiths.

## Narrative Hooks
- **The Silent Grove:** A Thalen grove where the spirits have stopped singing; the local Shaper fears a node collapse.
- **The Debt Collector:** An Oath-Wight that follows a character across regions, demanding payment for a forgotten promise.
- **The Memory Thief:** A Memory-Echo that has stolen a character's most precious recollection and is repeating it for all to hear.
