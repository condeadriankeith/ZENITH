## Name-Bleed Phenomenon

> In places afflicted by quarantine the air takes on a metallic tang, and wells hum a steady, reedy tone. Names leak like blood from a wound — at first a single proper name, then strange lapses: the bread's name slips away, the map forgets the river. When a name dies in a town a small bell somewhere tolls once, low and threadbare. People look at one another and find their mouths empty of memory.

This sensory description captures the experience of areas affected by name-loss. The phenomenon typically progresses from individual names to common nouns, creating zones where identity and meaning gradually dissolve.

## Encountering Creatures

Most supernatural entities in the Shattered Meridian world are not inherently evil but operate according to different value systems than humans. Understanding their motivations and needs is crucial for safe interaction:

- **Respect territorial boundaries** and the integrity of local nodes
- **Maintain proper naming** and identity practices
- **Honor commitments** and avoid breaking oaths
- **Approach with humility** rather than attempting to dominate

## Countermeasures

- **Salt-circle protection** (Kallum tradition): Preserves names and identities
- **Marble oaths** (Cyris tradition): Creates barriers against oath-breaking entities
- **Living-name rituals** (Thalen tradition): Maintains vitality of personal and place names
- **Rune-warding** (Virek tradition): Technological protections against entity intrusion
- **Star-warding** (Alkyr tradition): Astral protections against conceptual attacks
