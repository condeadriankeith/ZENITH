# ZENITH Style Guide: The Writing Constitution

## Core Aesthetic

The vibe is *Annihilation* meets *The Library of Babel*. Magic is not wonderous; it is a dangerous, logical system to be debugged. The tone is weary, cerebral, and horror-adjacent. The narrative should evoke the feeling of someone trying to solve an impossible puzzle while slowly being consumed by it.

## Narrative Constraints

### POV & Tense
- **Point of View:** Close third-person, past tense
- **Focus:** Deeply anchored in the Traveler's sensory and mental experience
- **Voice:** Weary, intellectual, precise, with an underlying sense of isolation

### Magic Description
Always describe magic with technical, informational, or cryptographic metaphors:
- "the ward's syntax was flawed"
- "he parsed the spell's intent"
- "the magical protocol had been corrupted"
- "she debugged the ritual's failure"
- "the God-Shard's data stream was fragmented"

### The Left-Hand Motif
This is not aesthetic. Every tool, interface, and common spell the Traveler encounters is *actively hostile* or *inconvenient* by design. This must create constant, low-level narrative friction:
- Magical interfaces designed for right-handed users
- Ancient mechanisms that require awkward positioning
- Ritual spaces that don't accommodate his natural movements
- Tools that feel wrong or cause strain when used with his left hand

### The God-Shards
They are not just powerful. They are *corrupting*, whispering, offering logical but catastrophic solutions to problems. Their presence should feel like a system vulnerability:
- They offer elegant solutions to complex problems
- They promise to fix things that are broken
- They reveal "truths" that are devastating to comprehend
- Their power comes with the slow degradation of the bearer's humanity

## Language & Style

### Prohibited Terms
Avoid vague or mystical language for magical concepts. Use precise, technical terminology instead.

### Technical Metaphors
Frame magical concepts as:
- Information processing systems
- Network protocols
- Data corruption/fragmentation
- Security vulnerabilities
- System debugging and patching
- Architectural blueprints and structural flaws

## Character Interaction Guidelines

- Characters should react to the Traveler's burden with a mixture of awe, fear, and pity
- Political figures should see him as a weapon to be controlled or eliminated
- Fellow mages should recognize the danger of his power
- The Traveler should rarely share his full burden with others

## Sensory Details

Ground all descriptions in the Traveler's immediate experience:
- How magic *feels* (electric, static, fragmenting reality)
- How God-Shards affect his body (pain, distortion, corruption)
- Environmental details that reflect the magical contamination
- The gradual wearing-down effect of his eternal task
