# Sound Motifs — *The Shattered Meridian*

## Regional Motifs
- **Cyris:** "High, clear bells and the scratching of styluses on marble. A background hum of rhythmic chanting (the Door-oaths)."
- **Thalen:** "Deep, resonant woodwinds and the sound of rustling leaves. A shimmering, prismatic synthesizer pad representing the sap-flow."
- **Virek:** "Rhythmic clanking of metal and the hiss of high-pressure steam. Low, mechanical drones and the crackle of arc-sparks."
- **Kallum:** "The slow, rhythmic breathing of waves and the creaking of old wood. A haunting, solitary cello representing the sea-memory."
- **Eirn:** "Sharp, icy winds and the sound of cracking glaciers. A low, guttural throat singing (the endurance-pacts)."
- **Sahru:** "Total silence interrupted by the occasional, threadbare tolling of a small bell. A dry, whistling wind."
- **The Hollow:** "A stagnant, heavy silence. A low-frequency throb that feels like a heartbeat held in check."

## Magic & Event Motifs
- **Left-Hand Rite:** "A sudden inversion of the local motif; major chords become minor, and the rhythm becomes irregular and jarring."
- **Meridian Lock:** "A sharp, metallic slam followed by a sudden drop in all ambient sound. A high-pitched, reedy tone that persists."
- **Name-Bleed:** "The sound of words being spoken but the meaning being lost. A metallic tang translated into a sharp, dissonant violin note."
- **Ascension:** "A massive, building orchestral swell that incorporates motifs from all regions, ending in a blinding, prismatic crescendo."
