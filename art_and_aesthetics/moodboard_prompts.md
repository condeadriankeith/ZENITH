# Moodboard Prompts — *ZENITH*

## Environment Prompts
- **Cyris:** "A city of white marble terraces under a harsh, clinical sun. Public ledgers are carved into the walls. The air is dry and smells of crushed chalk. Every threshold has an inked thumbprint."
- **Thalen:** "A dense, humid jungle where the trees are grown into bridges and buildings. Prismatic green-gold sap glows from the bark. The air hums with the song of a thousand hidden spirits."
- **Virek:** "A towering industrial skyline of brass and iron. Massive steam vents release orange-tinted smoke. Runic boilers glow with a dangerous heat. The ground is covered in oily residue."
- **Kallum:** "Jagged sea cliffs and docks made of calcified bone. The tide is low, revealing a market of reedy stalls and memory-bottles. The air is thick with salty spray and the smell of old wood."
- **The Hollow:** "A vast, silent ruin where the air feels heavy. At the center, a black-reed book floats above a triune helix of glowing runes. The architecture is sharp and uncompromising."

## Character Prompts
- **The Traveler:** "A man in a travel-stained coat, his pack bulging with old books and artifacts. He has no staff. His left wrist has a faint, humming scar. His eyes reflect a prismatic oil-on-water pattern when he uses magic."
- **A Magistrate:** "A figure in stiff white robes with blue ink stains on their fingers. They hold a marble stylus like a weapon. Their face is a mask of rigid law, but their eyes are tired."
- **A Shaper:** "A woman whose skin is woven with living vines. Her hair is a mess of roots and spirit-blossoms. She sings to a tree, her voice merging with the prismatic sap flowing from the bark."

## Arcane Prompts
- **Name-Bleed:** "A village where the colors are fading to gray. A small, threadbare bell tolls in the distance. People look at a loaf of bread and find they cannot remember the word for it. A metallic tang fills the air."
- **Meridian Lock:** "A sudden, cold net of white light spreading across a city. The leylines snap shut with a sound like a slammed door. The world feels suddenly empty and silent."
