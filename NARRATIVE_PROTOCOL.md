# ZENITH NARRATIVE PROTOCOL v3.0

## Section 1: The Quest Structure

Mandate that the primary plot is an **episodic journey**. Each major story beat is defined by a new location (documented in `/locations`), where the Traveler must secure a God-Shard from a unique political/magical conflict.

- Each location should present a unique challenge that reflects the nature of the God-Shard within it
- The political situation in each location should be complex, with multiple factions having legitimate claims or concerns
- The Traveler's intervention should have systemic consequences that ripple through the world
- Each episode should demonstrate the growing cost of the Traveler's burden

## Section 2: Character Dynamics

Establish the **"Burdened Trinity"** character archetypes that must be fleshed out in `/characters`:

1. **The Traveler:** The eternal custodian. His flaw is not doubt, but *hope* that there might be an end, which makes him vulnerable.
2. **The Fallen Mentor:** (Like Ryze's Tyrus). A figure who previously bore the vault's burden and failed, choosing either oblivion or tyranny. Their legacy is a warning.
3. **The Doomed Apprentice:** (Like Ryze's Brand). A character the Traveler tried to teach or share the burden with, who was ultimately corrupted by the power they sought to control. They are the primary antagonist, representing the "easy path" the Traveler rejects.

## Section 3: Integrating Lore

Define how content from `/archiva` enters the narrative: *only as discovered fragments, unreliable historical records, or technical manuals found by the Traveler during his quest.*

- Lore should feel like archaeological discoveries
- Ancient texts should be fragmentary and open to interpretation
- The Traveler's understanding of events should evolve as he gathers more pieces
- Contradictory accounts should exist, reflecting the unreliability of ancient sources

## Section 4: Pre-Flight Check (Mandatory)

Before writing, the AI MUST scan:
1. `narrative_flow/timeline.md` (Time of day/Health status)
2. `inventory/maer_inventory.md` (What items does he have?)
3. `locations/[current_location].md` (Sensory rules)
4. `archiva/artifacts/god_shard_[specific_shard].md` (Details of the current God-Shard)

## Section 5: Terminology Firewall

* **BANNED:** Resonance-Stylus, Glass-Cane, Shard-Bulb, God-Engine, Name-Bleed.
* **REQUIRED:** Stylus, Cane, Lamp, Engine, The Bleed.

## Section 6: Voice Matrix

* **Traveler/Maer:** Weary, intellectual, precise. Haunted by hope. (Logic tempered by desperation).
* **Eldra:** Aggressive, technical, fast. (Chaos).
* **Mira:** Clinical, cold. (Order).
* **God-Shards:** Seductive, logical, patient. Offering elegant solutions. (False wisdom).
