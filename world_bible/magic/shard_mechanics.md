# The Physics of Shards

## Core Principles
**Rule 1:** Shards are radioactive. They emit "Resonance."
**Rule 2:** Proximity causes "The Bleed."
    * **Mind Shard Exposure:** You lose names.
    * **Life Shard Exposure:** You grow tumors/moss.
    * **Body Shard Exposure:** Your bones shift/liquefy.
**Rule 3:** Shards *want* to be together. They vibrate harder when close to other Shards.

## The Five Shards
1.  **Crimson (The Body):** Governance over physical form, biology, and the visceral reality of flesh.
2.  **Azure (The Mind):** Governance over thought, recollection, and the collective consciousness.
3.  **Veridian (The Life):** Governance over growth, organic systems, and the web of living things.
4.  **Gold (The Order):** Governance over structure, stability, and the laws of physics.
5.  **Violet (The Void):** Governance over endings, entropy, and the space between definitions.

## The Cost: Name-Bleed
The fundamental cost of magic is **Name-Bleed**, a form of "Arcane Radiation" or **Cognitive Erosion**. The human mind was never designed to process or contain **Celestial Code**. To use magic is to allow this code to overwrite your biology.

- **Involuntary Nature:** Name-Bleed is not a payment you choose to make; it is a biological consequence of proximity and usage.
- **The Erosion:** Magic "eats" the user from the inside out. It begins by consuming small nouns (the name of a flower, the color of a childhood blanket) and gradually moves toward vital memories, eventually erasing the user's entire sense of self.
- **The Blank Slate:** The end state of advanced Name-Bleed is a "Hollow"—a physical body that continues to function but contains no identity, only the cold, cosmic logic of the Shard.

## The Mechanics

### Casting via Focus
To mitigate the effects of Name-Bleed, most practitioners use a **Focus** (Staves, Runes, Technomancy). These tools act as "lead shielding" for the mind, filtering the raw celestial energy into manageable frequencies. While this slows the erosion, it does not stop it entirely.

### Raw Casting
Touching a Shard directly or channeling energy without a focus—as the traveler Maer is forced to do—is known as **Raw Casting**. 
- **Power:** Grants immense, world-bending power that bypasses the limitations of focused magic.
- **Corruption:** Causes immediate, high-level corruption. A single act of Raw Casting can burn away years of a person's life and identity in seconds.

To hold a Shard is to hold the power of creation, but the price is the slow, inevitable loss of everything that makes you human.

## Additional Radiation Mechanics

**Rule:** Magic generates heat.
**Rule:** Magic causes "The Bleed" (Memory Loss).
**Rule:** Gold = Law/Stasis. Azure = Mind/Logic. Crimson = Body/Flesh.
