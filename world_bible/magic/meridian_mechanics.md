# Meridian Mechanics: Case Studies

> "To see the Meridian is to see the world's ledger. Every entry has a price, and the Auditors never sleep."

## Case Study 1: Village-Level Node Access (The Well of Oakhaven)
**Scenario:** Oakhaven's communal well, which sits atop a minor node, has begun to "hum" with high entropy. The village elders attempt a "Stabilization Rite" to prevent Name-Bleed.

- **The Process:** The elders gather at the well-head and recite the names of the village's founding families.
- **The Mechanic:** This is a "Communal Checksum." The Meridian Lattice recognizes the collective weight of these names as a valid payment for stabilization energy.
- **The Result:** The hum quiets.
- **The Cost:** For the next year, no one in Oakhaven can remember the specific dates of their ancestors' births. The "time-definition" of their history was consumed to stabilize the "water-definition" of the well.

## Case Study 2: Marble Codex Sealing (Cyris Legalism)
**Scenario:** A high-ranking Magistrate in Cyris wants to "Lock" a piece of evidence (a forbidden schematic) so it can never be read or remembered.

- **The Process:** The schematic is placed inside a marble-etched codex. The Magistrate applies their official Seal—a high-bandwidth link to the Cyris Node.
- **The Mechanic:** The Magistrate uses "Covenant Arcana" to create a localized Meridian Lock around the object. They are essentially "Quarantining" the schematic.
- **The Result:** The codex becomes physically indestructible and conceptually "invisible."
- **The Cost:** The Magistrate must "Sanction" the lock with a piece of their own authority. They lose the ability to speak the name of the person who created the schematic. To everyone else, the creator simply "never was."

## Case Study 3: Virek Foundry Accident (The Steam-Sprite Rupture)
**Scenario:** An experimental steam-engine in Virek, powered by a "Runic Patent" (an artificial name), suffers a containment breach.

- **The Process:** The engine's core begins to resonate with the local node's frequency, creating a feedback loop.
- **The Mechanic:** This is a "Pattern Match" trigger. The Meridian Lattice perceives the artificial name as a corruption of its own internal logic.
- **The Result:** The engine doesn't explode; it "Vanishes." A 10-meter sphere of the foundry simply becomes a "Hollow."
- **The Cost:** The three engineers working on the engine are caught in the "Bleeding." They emerge from the site physically intact but "Nameless." They can no longer recognize their own faces in a mirror, as their "Mirror-Definition" was harvested to seal the rupture.
