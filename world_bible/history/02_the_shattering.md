# The Shattering (The Division)
**Timeline:** 900 Years Ago.
**The Solution:** To save the world from Val-Kora, the "First Architects" split the fundamental resonance of reality into 5 Shards.
**The 5 Aspects:**
1. **Law (Gold):** Frozen order.
2. **Mind (Azure):** Pure logic.
3. **Life (Veridian):** Unchecked growth.
4. **Body (Crimson):** Physical form.
5. **Void (Violet):** The empty space between.
**The Consequence:** By separating these aspects, they broke the world into 5 distinct, extreme biomes.
