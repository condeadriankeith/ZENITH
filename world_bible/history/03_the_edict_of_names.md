# The Edict of Names (The Modern Era)
**Timeline:** Present Day.
**The Rule:** "To Name is to Remember; To Remember is to Sin."
**The Logic:** The Magistrates believe that "Memory" triggers Resonance. If people remember the past, the Shards will wake up.
**The Implementation:** The burning of books. The censorship of "Old Words." The creation of the "Silence."
