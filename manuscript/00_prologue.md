# Prologue: The Crown of the World 
 
 The air didn't get thinner here. It simply stopped existing. 
 
 Maer dragged his boot over the final ridge of black granite, his lungs burning with a cold that tasted of iron and vacuum. He was no longer in the world of men. He was standing on the **Zenith Plateau**—a flat, silent expanse of obsidian at the very tip of the world, scraping against the belly of the cosmos. 
 
 At the center of the plateau stood the **Star-Altar**. It wasn't built; it was grown—a perfect circle of white stone that hummed with a frequency that made Maer's teeth ache. This was the Doorstep. The place where mortals begged the sky for favors. 
 
 Below him, miles down through the clouds, the war was a silent flicker. The explosions of the Virek artillery and the White Hand’s chimeras were nothing more than sparks in a dying fire. They were fighting over borders. Maer was fighting for the right to exist. 
 
 He stumbled, his knee hitting the obsidian floor. The impact sent a jolt through the heavy vault strapped to his back. 
 
 *Let us out,* the voices whispered. They didn't come from the wind; they came from the violet ink etched into his skin. *The cage is too small, little scholar. Break it.* 
 
 "I... am trying," Maer wheezed, blood freezing black on his beard. 
 
 He stood up and limped toward the Altar. The sky above the plateau tore open. 
 
 It wasn't a cloud parting. It was reality peeling back. The stars didn't twinkle; they stared. A massive shape descended from the void, formed of constellations and cold silence. 
 
 **Val-Kora, the Star-Warden.** 
 
 The Celestial loomed over the plateau, a construct of living geometry and starlight, beautiful and terrifyingly indifferent. 
 
 *"Mortals,"* Val-Kora’s voice boomed, bypassing Maer’s ears and vibrating directly in his marrow. *"Should not meddle with the power of the Gods."* 
 
 Maer looked up. His eyes were already gone—burned away by the Name-Bleed, replaced by twin pools of shifting, prismatic light. 
 
 "We aren't meddling," Maer whispered, his voice cracking against the silence. 
 
 He reached over his shoulder. The leather straps hissed as the heavy vault hit the white stone of the Altar. He didn't lock it. He drew his dagger. 
 
 *“What are you doing?”* Val-Kora’s voice shifted, a tremor of genuine confusion shaking the starlight. 
 
 "I am correcting a mistake," Maer said. 
 
 He drove the dagger into the lock of the vault. He didn't turn it. He **shattered** it. 
 
 The metal casing exploded. 
 
 Five distinct lights screamed into the vacuum, swirling around Maer like a hurricane of solid color. 
 * **Crimson** (The Aspect of Blood). 
 * **Azure** (The Aspect of Mind). 
 * **Veridian** (The Aspect of Root). 
 * **Gold** (The Aspect of Law). 
 * **Violet** (The Aspect of Void). 
 
 They didn't fly away. They dove into him. 
 
 Maer threw his head back in a silent scream as the Shards drove themselves into his flesh. His skin split and reformed, the runes glowing so bright they turned his silhouette into a star. The pain was absolute. It was the pain of a planet being born inside a human chest. 
 
 The Celestial raised a hand, summoning a spear of judgment. *"Stop! You cannot hold the Foundation. You will unmake yourself!"* 
 
 Maer snapped his head forward. He caught the Star-Warden’s gaze. 
 
 He raised his left hand. The five colors swirled in his palm, mixing, churning, becoming something new—**Prismatic Oil**, thick, heavy, and terrifyingly beautiful. The power of creation, condensed into five fingers. 
 
 Val-Kora froze. He recognized the energy. It wasn't divine anymore. It was *alive*. 
 
 Maer looked at the God, and then he looked down at the white stone floor of the Altar beneath his boots. 
 
 "You hoarded this light because you were afraid of what we would build with it," Maer said, his voice sounding like grinding tectonic plates. 
 
 He turned his palm downward, hovering inches above the Altar. 
 
 "But this world doesn't belong to you anymore." 
 
 Val-Kora lunged. *"NO!"* 
 
 Maer didn't flinch. 
 
 **"We are inheriting."** 
 
 He slammed his hand onto the floor. 
 
 **BOOM.** 
 
 A waterfall of prismatic fire erupted from his palm, flooding the plateau instantly. It didn't blast upward; it flowed like liquid mercury, rushing across the obsidian surface and spilling over the edge of the Zenith. 
 
 It was a flood. Thick, iridescent waves of magic cascaded down the slopes of the mountain, crashing through the cloud layer like a tsunami of light. 
 
 Below, the war stopped. 
 Soldiers dropped their rifles. Mages lowered their staffs. 
 They looked up to see the sky turning into a painting. The Aurora of the First Breath washed over the trenches, the cities, the ruins. Where it touched the dead, flowers of crystal bloomed. Where it touched the sick, breath returned. 
 
 It was horrifyingly beautiful. The world wasn't just healing; it was *changing*. 
 
 On the plateau, Maer fell to his knees. The flow didn't stop. He was the open door now. The conduit. The power of the Gods poured through his spine and into the earth, anchoring the age of magic to the age of men. 
 
 Val-Kora faded, banished by the sheer density of the reality Maer had created. 
 
 Maer remained kneeling on the empty summit, a statue of flesh and infinite light, emptying himself to fill the world. 
 And somewhere, deep in the roots of the earth, something ancient opened its eyes.
