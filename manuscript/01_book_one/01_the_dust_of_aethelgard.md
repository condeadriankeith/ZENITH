## Scene 1: The Ink and the Ozone

The morning bell of the Grand Athenaeum did not ring; it vibrated. It was a heavy, administrative thrum that originated deep within the building’s foundation, a resonance designed to shake the dust from the vellum and the sleep from the Archivists. For Maer, it felt like a hammer striking the base of his skull, a reminder that another day of silence had begun.

He sat up in his narrow cot, his joints popping in a sequence he had long since memorized. His quarters were a literal crack in the wall of the library, a vertical sliver of space wedged between the Genealogy of the Low-Lords and the Tax Ledgers of the Fourth Era. Here, the air was thick and sweet, heavy with the scent of decaying paper, vanilla-rot, and the dry, ancient dust that Maer considered his only true inheritance.

Maer reached for his washbasin. The water was cold, filmed with a thin layer of grey sediment. He dipped his hands in, the ritual as mechanical as the clockwork that drove the city’s Shard-gates. He scrubbed, his fingers working over the pads of his palms and the deep lines of his cuticles. But the ink remained. It was a permanent cartography of his service—a deep, bruised violet that had seeped into his pores over twenty years of transcribing redacted histories. It was the mark of the Keeper: the man who touched the dead words so others wouldn't have to.

He dried his hands on a rag that was more grey than white, then stood and walked to the single, narrow slit of a window that looked out over the Golden Sector of Cyris.

The contrast always made his head ache—a dull, rhythmic pulse he had come to recognize as the first sign of Shard-fatigue. Outside, the city was a blinding monument to order. Cyris was built of bone-white stone, polished to a mirror sheen and interlaced with intricate gold filigree that caught the artificial sunlight of the Meridian Lattice. It was beautiful in a way that felt violent. 

The "Valis Patrols"—the high-altitude skiffs of High Inquisitor Oren Valis—drifted through the canyons between the spires like silent, predatory birds. Their hulls were white and gold, matching the architecture, making them nearly invisible until they banked and caught the light. They were looking for leaks, for anomalies, for the faint shimmer of unauthorized resonance.

Maer leaned his forehead against the cold glass. The smell of the city drifted in even through the sealed pane—a sharp, clinical scent of sterile ozone. It was the smell of the Gold Shard containment fields that powered Cyris, a scent that tasted like copper on the tongue and made the teeth ache. 

He preferred the dust. The city was too clean, too bright, scrubbed of its history by the Magistrates until only a perpetual, shimmering present remained. In Cyris, the past was a liability, and the Grand Athenaeum was its prison.

"Good morning, Book," Maer whispered, his voice a dry rasp. He was looking at a thick, leather-bound volume on his nightstand: *The Migration of the Silt-Strider*. It hadn't been requested by a reader in three centuries. "I hope the damp didn't settle in your spine last night."

The book did not answer, but Maer felt the weight of its presence. He talked to the books because there was no one else. The other Archivists were shadows in the halls, cowed by the Law of Silence, their tongues clipped by the fear of saying the wrong name. In the Grand Athenaeum, curiosity was a slow-acting poison, and Maer had survived this long only because he had learned to direct his questions to the dead rather than the living.

He pulled on his charcoal-grey robes, the fabric stiff with starch and age. As he cinched the belt, his left hand twitched—a phantom itch in the palm that always came when the morning bell finished its tolling. He looked down at it. The skin was pale, but there was a faint, silvery sheen to the scars on his knuckles, a residue of a memory he had spent years trying to erase.

He was a Keeper of Dead Things. It was a title he had given himself, a secret name held close to the chest. To the world, he was just Archivist Maer, a man who lived in the cracks of the wall. But to the books, he was the only one who still knew their names.

## Scene 2: The Click-Clack of Judgment

The Main Hall of the Grand Athenaeum was a cathedral of silence, its vaulted ceilings disappearing into a gloom that even the lights couldn't pierce. Maer was at his station, a high-backed mahogany desk scarred by decades of ink-spills, sorting a stack of "Unverified Texts" from the outer rim.

Before him lay a "Redaction Order," a slip of grey paper signed with the geometric seal of the Magistrate’s Office. Beside it sat a volume bound in sea-foam green leather, its title—*The Rhythms of Kallum*—already marked with the red ink of condemnation. 

Maer opened the book to the flagged page. The prose was handwritten, the ink a deep, rich indigo that had survived three centuries of salt-air and neglect. He read the passage, his eyes tracing the elegant loops of the script.

*“The Festival of Tides began not with a sound, but with a smell—the scent of crushed jasmine and brine carried on the first wind of the equinox. In the harbor of Kallum, the children would cast lanterns of hollowed driftwood into the surf, each flame representing a memory they wished to keep for another year. As the lanterns drifted toward the horizon, the city would fall into a silence that was not empty, but full of the collective breath of ten thousand souls, waiting for the sea to answer.”*

Maer swallowed, the words tasting like a life he had never known. In Cyris, lanterns were for illumination, and the sea was a regulated resource, partitioned by the Gold Shards. The idea of a silence being *full* was a heresy.

He reached for the stylus, a heavy, silver tool that felt cold in his hand. He checked the frequency dial; it was set to the specific vibration of the Kallum indigo ink. With a deep breath, he pressed the tip of the stylus to the first word—*The*.

As he dragged the stylus across the page, the tool emitted a high-pitched, crystalline whine. The paper beneath the tip began to shimmer, the ink unbinding from the fibers in a microscopic storm of static. To anyone else, it might have looked like magic; to Maer, it looked like murder.

The smell of the ink dissolving filled his nostrils—a cloying, sweet scent of burnt sugar and chemical rot. He watched as the lanterns of Kallum were vibrated into dust, the beautiful driftwood and the jasmine-scented wind disappearing into a void of white, empty vellum. The collective breath of ten thousand souls was replaced by a clean, dead surface that had never known a human thought.

Maer’s left hand gripped the edge of the desk so hard his knuckles turned white. He hated the precision of the tool. He hated the way it left the page so smooth, as if the words had never existed. By the time he reached the final period, his eyes were burning, and the "Redaction Order" was complete. The past was neutralized. The silence was maintained.

He closed the book, the sea-foam green leather feeling like a corpse in his hands. He was about to reach for the next volume when the silence of the Main Hall was broken not by a voice, but by a sound that made Maer’s stomach tighten into a hard, cold knot.

*Click. Clack. Click. Clack.*

It was the sound of glass on obsidian. Maer didn't look up; he didn't need to. He knew the rhythm. 

Senior Archivist Mira Glass did not walk; she measured the world with every step. She appeared from the shadows of the Genealogy section, a woman made of sharp angles and the smell of antiseptic. Her robes were a blinding, bleached white, and she carried a cane made of transparent glass—a rod filled with shimmering gold mercury that pulsed in time with the building's resonance.

But it was her arms that drew the eye. Strapped to her forearms were her lenses, a complex array of rotating glass discs and brass gears. As she approached Maer’s desk, the lenses shifted and whirred, making a series of tiny, metallic *clicks*.

"Archivist Maer," she said. Her voice was like the snap of dry parchment. She didn't look at him; her eyes were obscured by the shifting reflections in the lenses as they scanned the table.

"Senior Archivist," Maer replied, bowing his head. He kept his hands flat on the desk, making sure his left hand was partially obscured by a stack of ledgers.

Mira Glass leaned over his work, the lenses on her left arm rotating rapidly. *Click-click-click.* The lenses weren't for seeing; they were for detecting. They measured the "frequency" of the texts, looking for the tell-tale vibration of unauthorized history.

"Inefficient," she murmured, the mercury in her cane surging toward the handle. "You are three minutes behind the morning quota. The sorting of the Outer Rim shipment is incomplete."

"The ink is faded on several volumes, Senior Archivist," Maer said, his voice steady despite the hammering of his heart. "I had to use the low-spectrum lamp to verify the titles."

Mira Glass straightened, her lenses locking into a new configuration. The smell of antiseptic—sharp and clinical—intensified. "There is no need to verify titles that have already been slated for the purge. High Inquisitor Valis has issued a new directive. All 'Unverified Texts' from the Virek region are to be processed for immediate redaction. We are no longer cataloging the errors of the past; we are erasing them."

Maer felt a sharp pang of grief, a phantom pain that felt like a needle in his eye. "Erasing them? But the Virek shipment contains the only surviving records of the Old Foundry..."

"Curiosity is the first stage of the bleed," Mira Glass interrupted, her cane striking the floor with a sharp *clack*. "History is a frequency, Maer. If the frequency is inconsistent with the Law of Silence, it must be neutralized. Do you wish to experience the dizziness, Archivist? Do you wish to feel your own name slipping away like sand through a sieve?"

Maer lowered his gaze. He knew the threat. Name-Bleed was the price of magic, the cognitive erosion that happened when a mortal touched the raw power of the Meridian. The Magistrates used it as a bogeyman, but Maer had felt the edges of it—the sudden, terrifying void where a memory used to be.

"No, Senior Archivist."

"Then finish this stack and report to Sector 4. The sub-basement has received a shipment of 'Industrial Dross' from the Rust Sprawl. You will sort it before the evening bell. Since you find the 'faded inks' so fascinating, you can spend your afternoon in the dark."

She turned, the mercury in her cane settling back into a slow, rhythmic pulse. *Click. Clack. Click. Clack.*

Maer watched her go, his eyes lingering on the white and gold of her robes. He hated her. He hated the way she looked at books as if they were infections to be cured. He hated the way the city of Cyris had turned the act of remembering into a crime.

He looked down at the stack of books on his desk. They were to be redacted—vibrated until the ink shook loose and the pages became blank, white ghosts. 

He reached out and touched the spine of the top volume. It was cold. Everything in the Grand Athenaeum was cold.

He turned away from the desk and walked toward the Great Descent, the massive vertical shaft that housed the Athenaeum’s internal transport system. 

The service lift was a cage of rusted iron that groaned as he stepped inside. He engaged the primary lever, and with a shudder that vibrated through the soles of his boots, the cage began to drop.

The journey from the surface to the depths was a descent through the geological layers of the city’s filtered memory. Through the iron grate of the lift, Maer watched the strata of Cyris slide by.

First came the **Hall of Consensus**. This was the public face of the library—a place of bone-white marble and brilliant Gold Shard lighting. Here, the ceilings were gold-leafed and the Archivists wore robes of pristine silk. It was a level of propaganda and "Verified" truth, where the air smelled of expensive incense and the history was as polished as the floors. It was the world of the Magistrates, bright and blindingly empty.

As the lift dropped past Floor -10, the light began to fail. He entered the **Vault of Closed Lineages**. Here, the marble gave way to grey limestone, and the air grew heavy with the scent of stagnant dust. This was where the records of the Noble Houses were kept—the families that had been "discontinued" by the Courts. The shelves here were caked in centuries of neglect, the crests on the spines obscured by a grey shroud of spider-silk and rot. It was a dark, silent forest of forgotten bloodlines, where the only sound was the drip of condensation from the overhead pipes.

By Floor -50, the architecture changed entirely. The lift descended into the **Roots**. Here, the hand of man was less evident, the library merging with the ancient, black granite of the mountain itself. The walls were rough and damp, carved with the jagged marks of the first excavators. The brilliant gold of the lights was replaced by the sickly, flickering violet of low-output bulbs, casting long, distorted shadows that seemed to reach for the lift as it passed. 

The air turned freezing, carrying the metallic tang of the earth's deep veins. The "hum" of the city—that constant, administrative vibration that Maer felt even in his sleep—faded away, replaced by a silence so heavy it felt like a physical pressure against his chest. 

Maer leaned his head against the cold iron of the cage. He felt like he was descending into the gut of a beast that had spent a thousand years eating the world's history. He was leaving the "Golden Sector" and its curated lies, traveling down into the dark, churning stomach where the truth was digested into dross.

The lift finally slowed, the gears screaming as they fought against the weight of the descent. With a final, bone-jarring thud, the cage came to a halt.

## Scene 3: The Deep Stacks (Sector 4)

Sector 4 was where the Grand Athenaeum stopped being a library and started being a tomb.

The air here was stale, uncirculated, and so thick it felt like wool in the mouth. The walls were rough-hewn granite, weeping saltpetre in the dim light of the flickering, low-output bulbs. This was the "Dregs," the library’s subconscious, where the "Industrial Dross" of the world was sent to be forgotten.

Maer stepped out of the lift, his boots echoing on the uneven floor. The shipment from the Rust Sprawl—the industrial wasteland of the Virek region—sat in the center of the sorting bay. Ten massive crates of splintered wood, bound in rusted iron hoops and caked in a fine layer of grey, metallic ash.

He pulled on a pair of heavy, lead-lined gloves. In the Dregs, you didn't touch anything with bare skin. The materials recovered from the Sprawl often carried residual resonance, a "static" that could cause the bleed in a matter of seconds.

He began the work. It was a rhythmic, soul-crushing process. He broke open the first crate with a crowbar, the sound echoing through the dark stacks like a gunshot. Inside was a jumble of twisted metal, charred parchment, and water-damaged tax ledgers. 

"Nothing but rust and regret," Maer muttered to the empty room. 

Hours passed. His back ached, and his eyes burned from the metallic dust. He moved through the crates with the efficiency of a man who had long ago given up on finding anything of value. 

### The Archaeology of Rust

The second crate was a graveyard of utility. Maer pried the lid back, the wood screaming as the rusted nails surrendered their grip. A cloud of fine, ochre dust erupted, settling into the creases of his lead-lined gloves and the charcoal-grey fabric of his robes. This was not the noble dust of the High Stacks—the powdered remains of thought and philosophy—but the bitter, abrasive grit of the Rust Sprawl. It smelled of sulfur, of scorched copper, and of a deep, pervasive exhaustion.

The Magistrates called this "Industrial Dross," a category designed to strip the items of their history before they were even cataloged. To Mira Glass, these were just data-points of failure, the debris of a region that had failed to maintain the required resonance-purity. But as Maer reached into the crate, his fingers brushed against something that didn't feel like dross.

He pulled out a small, heavy object. It was a child’s filter, a common piece of improvised survival gear from the Virek region. It was a crude thing, fashioned from scrap brass and soldered with lead that had begun to turn a sickly, chalky white. 

Maer held it up to the dim light of the flickering bulb. The filter was small enough to fit in the palm of his hand, its surface covered in a web of deep, jagged scratches. One side was crushed, the delicate brass mesh beneath the casing torn open like a wound. 

He pulled a small, stiff brush from his belt—a tool meant for cleaning ancient vellum—and began to work on the filter. He brushed away the thick crust of coal-dust and ash, revealing the dull, tarnished gold of the brass. Beneath the grit, he found a stain that the dust hadn't been able to hide. A dark, brownish residue that had seeped into the metal’s pores.

Dried blood.

The smell hit him then—a metallic, copper tang that sliced through the library’s vanilla-rot. It was the smell of a struggle, of a small body fighting for a breath that the air of the Rust Sprawl wouldn't provide. Maer felt a sudden, sharp pressure in his own chest, a sympathetic ache that made the air in Sector 4 feel even thinner.

He found himself cleaning it with a reverence that would have earned him a month in the Silence if Mira Glass had seen him. He polished the brass until he could see the distorted reflection of his own ink-stained face in the metal. 

On the underside of the filter, he found a series of tiny, hand-carved marks. They weren't letters, but a sequence of notches—a tally of days, or perhaps a child’s attempt at a name. In Cyris, names were sacred things, regulated by the Codex Courts and protected by the Meridian Lattice. In the Rust Sprawl, a name was something you scratched into a piece of scrap brass so you wouldn't forget who you were when the sickness started.

Maer looked up at the weeping granite walls of the sub-basement. Above him, the city of Cyris sat in its bone-white splendor, bathed in the artificial sunlight of the Gold Shards. The citizens of the Golden Sector didn't need filters. Their air was scrubbed of every impurity, every memory, every trace of the world that had existed before the Fracture. They lived in a world of perfect, sterile silence, while down here, the debris of their "purity" was piled in crates like trash.

"You were someone," Maer whispered to the filter. "You breathed through this. You fought for your name."

He set the filter down on his sorting table, separate from the "To Be Pulped" pile. It was a small, treasonous act of empathy. He couldn't save the child, and he couldn't change the Law of Silence, but he could refuse to call this dross. 

He reached back into the crate, his hands trembling slightly. He found a pair of work-boots, the leather cracked and stiffened by saltpetre. He found a cracked resonance-dial, its needle frozen at a frequency that shouldn't exist. He found a locket that contained only a pinch of grey ash.

Each object was a witness. Each was a fragment of a life that the Magistrates had redacted from the official record. Maer worked through the crate, no longer a cataloger of data, but a witness to a funeral. He cleaned the ash from the boots; he straightened the needle on the dial. 

The silence of Sector 4 felt different now. It was no longer just the absence of sound; it was the weight of a thousand silenced voices, pressing against the stone, demanding to be heard. Maer’s left hand throbbed, the silver scars on his knuckles pulsing with a rhythmic, phantom heat. He was a Keeper of Dead Things, and for the first time in twenty years, the responsibility of that title felt like it might break him.

He reached into the fourth crate, his hand disappearing into a nest of shredded vellum and dried mud. He felt the familiar weight of a book, but as his fingers closed around the binding, a sudden, sharp jolt of electricity shot up his arm.

He pulled his hand back, a gasp escaping his lips. His head swam for a second—a brief, nauseating wave of the sickness that made the room tilt. He blinked, waiting for the dizziness to pass.

He reached in again, more cautiously this time. 

The book was small, no larger than a prayer-book, and it was caked in a layer of black, oily grime. He pulled it out and wiped the surface with a rag. 

As the grime came away, it revealed a binding of deep, midnight blue—a color so intense it seemed to draw the dim light of the Shard-bulbs into itself. It looked like a standard ledger, the kind used by the Virek foundry-masters, but as Maer held it, he felt a vibration.

It wasn't a mechanical vibration. It was a pulse.

*Thrum. Thrum. Thrum.*

Maer stared at it. There was no title on the spine. No serial number. No mark of the Codex Courts. It was a book that didn't exist in any ledger. 

He felt a sudden, sharp prickle of alarm. In Cyris, an unmarked book was a death sentence. But as he looked at the blue binding, he saw a faint, golden filigree beginning to shimmer through the grime. It wasn't the rigid, geometric gold of the city; it was something fluid, something organic, like a vine of light.

He knew what this was. He had read about them in the "Prohibited Appendices" before they were burned. 

It was a Lock.

## Scene 4: The Resonance

The heat hit him before he could even process the thought.

It wasn't the warmth of a room or the glow of a lamp. It was a searing, prismatic heat that bypassed his lead-lined gloves and sank directly into the marrow of his bones. Maer gasped, nearly dropping the volume, but his fingers seemed to lock around the binding of their own accord.

Time did not stop, but it became viscous, a thick, amber fluid that Maer was forced to swim through. The flicker of the Shard-bulb above his head slowed until he could see the individual pulses of light, each one a jagged, electric scream in the dark. The sound of his own breath became a low, thunderous roar, and the drip of saltpetre from the granite walls sounded like the tolling of a funeral bell.

The heat was the first thing to truly break him. 

It wasn't a surface burn. It was an invasion. He could feel the resonance traveling up his arm, vein by vein, a line of liquid fire that ignored the lead-lining of his gloves. He looked down at his right arm and saw the veins beneath the skin beginning to glow with a faint, violet light. It looked like a map of a city he didn't recognize, a network of illuminated streets that were being paved with his own blood.

The heat reached his elbow, and the silver scars on his knuckles didn't just glow; they hissed. A faint, acrid smell rose from his skin—the smell of singing hair and ozone, the scent of a memory being cauterized. 

"Stop," he tried to say, but his tongue was a heavy, useless thing in his mouth.

Then the first wave of the bleed hit. It wasn't the dizziness he had felt before; it was a violent, surgical removal. 

Maer reached for his mother’s face. It was his anchor, the one image he had kept protected in the deepest vaults of his mind. He tried to think of the way she looked when she sang the lullaby, the way the light caught the fine, silver-blonde hairs at her temples. 

He saw her eyes—deep, warm brown, like the tea she used to brew. But as the violet heat reached his shoulder, the image blurred. The brown turned to grey, then to a flat, featureless white. He tried to hold onto the shape of her nose, the curve of her smile, but they were being vibrated into nothingness. It was like watching a redacted text in real-time, the ink of his life being shaken loose from the vellum of his soul.

*No,* he screamed in the silence of his mind. *Not her.*

He fought. He threw every scrap of his willpower against the resonance, trying to rebuild the memory. He recalled the smell of her lavender soap, the rough texture of her wool shawl. But the violet light was relentless. It burned through the sensory details, replacing them with a terrifying, cosmic clarity. 

Where his mother’s face had been, there was now only the Zenith—the white-hot point of the Meridian Lattice, the source of all order and all destruction. It was beautiful, and it was empty. 

The heat reached his heart. 

The pain was so absolute it became a kind of peace. Maer felt the connection between his body and the floor dissolve. He was no longer an Archivist in a sub-basement; he was a frequency being tuned. He could feel the entire library above him—the thousands of books, the millions of words, the millions of silenced thoughts—vibrating in sympathy with the book in his hands.

He realized then that the Codex was not just a book. It was a "Lock," yes, but a lock is only as important as what it holds back. This volume was a bridge to a world that Cyris had tried to kill, a world where names were not regulated and history was not redacted.

The choice was a jagged, crystalline thing in the center of his chest. 

He could let go. If he dropped the book now, the resonance would fade. He would be left with a permanent tremor in his right hand and a hole in his memory where his mother’s face used to be, but he would be alive. He could go back to his narrow quarters, back to his ink-stained life, back to the safety of the silence.

Or he could hold on. 

He could trade his mind for the truth. He could let the violet light burn away everything he was until only the Keeper remained. He could become a vessel for a frequency that the world hadn't heard in a thousand years.

Maer looked at the blue volume, his eyes streaming from the heat. He thought of the child’s lung-filter on the table. He thought of the blood-stains and the hand-carved notches. He thought of the millions of "Unverified" lives that were being erased every day in the name of order.

He didn't let go.

He tightened his grip, his fingers digging into the midnight-blue binding. The heat surged, a final, blinding wave of prismatic energy that turned the entire sub-basement into a violet sun. Maer’s vision went white, and the last thing he heard before the silence returned was the sound of his mother’s lullaby, sung in a voice that was no longer his own.

When the light finally faded, Maer was still on his knees. 

His lungs burned, drawing in the stale, damp air of the sub-basement with a ragged, desperate rhythm. The silence that rushed back into the room was not the empty quiet he was used to; it was heavy, pressing against his eardrums like the weight of the entire city above him. The granite walls looked normal again—grey, weeping with saltpetre, indifferent—but the normalcy felt like a lie. The memory of the violet sun was still seared into his retinas, a ghost-image that made the real world look thin and fragile, a painted screen over a deeper, more violent reality.

He looked down at his right hand. The glove had been charred away at the fingertips, exposing the pale, scarred skin of his palm. The ritual marks were no longer white; they were a dull, throbbing crimson, pulsing with an internal heat that felt like a slow-burning fever. He flexed his fingers, expecting them to be stiff or broken, but they moved with a fluid, terrifying precision. The tremor was gone. In its place was a stillness so absolute it was unnatural.

With trembling hands, Maer reached for the Codex of the First Breath. It lay on the stone floor, its midnight-blue binding appearing almost black in the dim light of the Shard-bulbs. As his fingers brushed the leather, a spark of static jumped between the book and his skin, a sharp, electric bite that tasted of ozone. 

He didn't hesitate. He pulled the heavy volume to his chest and slid it into the deep, hidden pocket of his inner robes. 

The sensation was immediate. It wasn't just the weight of the book; it was the *heat*. The Codex felt like a thrumming coal, a secret sun pressed directly against his ribs. He could feel the resonance vibrating through his sternum, a low-frequency hum that seemed to synchronize with his own heartbeat. It was a dangerous warmth, a ticking clock that threatened to ignite the very fabric of his uniform.

Maer forced himself to stand. His legs felt like lead, and his head swam with the sudden rush of vertigo. He didn't look back at the table where the child’s lung-filter still lay, or at the dark corners of Sector 4 where the shadows seemed to be watching him. He turned and stumbled toward the service lift.

The iron gate of the lift was cold and slick with condensation. When he pulled it shut, the sound of metal sliding against metal was a jagged scream in the silence. He engaged the gears, and the lift began its slow, groaning ascent. 

Usually, the mechanical rhythm of the Athenaeum’s infrastructure was a comfort to him—a sign of the City of Cyris’s unshakeable order. Now, every clank of the chain and every shudder of the platform felt like a physical assault. The gears sounded like grinding teeth; the steam-hiss of the hydraulics sounded like a warning.

As the lift rose out of the damp dark of the sub-basement and toward the pristine, clinical white of the Golden Sector, Maer felt the air change. The smell of dust and ancient parchment was replaced by the sharp, sterile scent of ozone and expensive incense. The flickering Shard-bulbs were replaced by the steady, brilliant glow of the Meridian Lattice.

He stepped out of the lift and into the hallway. The silence here was different. It was the silence of a tomb, or a museum where the exhibits were not allowed to breathe. He looked at the white marble floors, the gold-leafed arches, and the rows of perfectly aligned archives. He had spent his entire life within these walls, believing that this silence was his sanctuary, his protection against the chaos of the world outside.

He touched the hidden weight against his ribs. The secret sun was still there, burning through the silk of his robes, reminding him of the face he had lost and the world he had found.

He looked down the long, empty corridor toward the main doors. For the first time in his life, the Grand Athenaeum did not feel like a library. 

It felt like a cage.
