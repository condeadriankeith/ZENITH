 Logline: "To save the world below, he must burn the world above." 
**Dedication:** For those who carry the weight of worlds they did not build.

**Blurb:**
Aethelgard is a world on the brink of the Great Filter—a cosmic reset designed by the Celestials to purge civilizations that grow too powerful. Maer, a former librarian turned Keeper of the Vault, has shattered the ancient seals to prevent the reset, but in doing so, he has scattered the five World Shards across the broken lands. 

Now, Maer must journey across the fractured regions to collect the Shards—Crimson, Azure, Veridian, Gold, and Violet—before the Celestials can reclaim them. But the power of the Shards comes with a terrible price: Name-Bleed. With every Shard he claims, Maer's own humanity and memories are burned away to make room for cosmic power. 

In a world of synthetic gods and industrial wastelands, Maer must decide: how much of himself is he willing to lose to save a world that was never meant to be his?

## Narrative Voice & Style Guidelines
- **Atmospheric Tone:** Mythic industrialism. High stakes, heavy atmosphere, focused on the sensory experience of Name-Bleed and cosmic scale.
- **Prose Constraints:** Use prismatic imagery and metallic metaphors. Maintain the weight of "Inheritance" as a core theme.
- **Stylistic Motifs:** The Five Aspects, the thinning of the Veil, and the silent judgment of the Stars.
