# Narrative Scene: Trial in Cyris — *The Shattered Meridian*

The white terraces of Cyris were blinding under the midday sun. The Traveler stood at the back of the Pillar Square, his pack heavy and his left wrist humming with a low, anxious frequency. At the center of the square, a woman knelt before the High Magistrate.

"Elara of the Third Terrace," the Magistrate’s voice rang out, clear and sharp like a marble chisel. "You are accused of an unsanctioned healing. A left-hand rite, performed upon your own child."

Elara did not look up. Her hands were stained with a prismatic green-gold residue—the mark of Thalen spirit-sap. "He was dying," she whispered. "The fever... it was taking his breath. The Codex Courts had no remedy."

"The Law is the remedy," the Magistrate countered. "By bypassing the authorized leylines, you have introduced entropy into this node. You have medded with the power of the Gods, Elara."

The Traveler watched as the Magistrate held up a marble stylus. "The Three Laws of Ascension are absolute. Law One: Irrecoverable Cost. You healed your son’s body, but what did you give to the Meridian in exchange?"

Elara finally looked up, her eyes wide with a sudden, dawning horror. "I... I don't know."

From the edge of the square, a small child—Elara’s son—wandered into the light. He looked healthy, his cheeks flushed with life. He saw his mother and smiled, but as he opened his mouth to call out, he paused. A look of confusion crossed his face.

"Mother?" Elara prompted, her voice trembling.

The child tilted his head. He looked at her as if she were a stranger. "Who... who are you?"

A collective gasp went through the crowd. The Magistrate’s face remained a mask of stone. "The Meridian has taken its due. You traded your son’s memory of you for his life. A fragment lost forever."

The Traveler felt a pang of familiar grief. He thought of the lullaby he could no longer finish. He thought of the name he had traded for a valley that didn't even know he existed. 

"In places afflicted by quarantine the air takes on a metallic tang, and wells hum a steady, reedy tone," the Traveler murmured to himself, recognizing the first signs of Name-Bleed in the Square. "Names leak like blood from a wound."

He turned away as the Magistrate began the ritual of Sealing. The Square was already starting to feel thinner, the colors of the marble losing their luster. He had seen this before. The Law didn't just punish; it erased.

He adjusted his pack and began the long climb toward the Crossroads. He had a promise to keep, and the price was only getting higher.
