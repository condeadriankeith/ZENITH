Sera of the Tide — The Fallout-Oracle

Slug: sera_of_the_tide.md
Region: Kallum

A blind seer who reads the oily iridescence of the Kallum tides, Sera tracks the spread of Name-Bleed and the world’s decaying nodes. She is the only one who hears the "breathing" of the deep Shard-Residue.

Sera stands on the bone-white docks of Kallum, her eyes milky and unseeing, veiled by a thin strip of translucent sea-silk. Her skin is weathered like driftwood, etched with salt-crust patterns that shimmer when the tide rises. She wears a heavy cloak of matted kelp-fiber, and her fingers are stained indigo from the ink of resonance-bones she carries in a bundle at her hip.

Sera serves as a reluctant mentor and harbinger, providing the Traveler with the sensory keys needed to navigate the shifting fallout-zones of the coast. She is a source of cryptic warnings and deep-world lore.

The rhythmic clicking of resonance-bones against her hip and the smell of ozone and brine that precedes her arrival.

## Relationship to World Shards
- **Motivation:** Sera sees the "Violet Shard" (Void) in the depths of the sea. She believes the Great Filter is already beginning to "drain" the world's integrity into the void.
- **Goal:** Help Maer navigate the tidal-currents of the Void Shard's influence.

## Moral Contradictions
- She is an oracle who can see the spread of the Filter, but she is blind to her own impending Name-Bleed.
- She serves the tide, but she fears the Shard-Hunger will turn the ocean into a desert of static.

- Act I — Ch. 4 (The Salt-Bleached Docks): Sera senses the Traveler's arrival and warns them of the "silence" growing in the deep nodes, providing the first hint of the Filter's deepening.
- Act II — Ch. 12 (The Oily Reach): Sera guides the Traveler through a submerged fallout-path, using her own cognitive stability to keep the path open against the rising pressure.
- Act III — Ch. 22 (The Tide's End): Sera witnesses the final collapse of the Kallum node and gives the Traveler her last resonance-bone, containing the coordinates of the Hollow.

The mist was thick enough to chew, a heavy blanket of salt and Arcane Fallout that clung to the Traveler’s cloak. At the edge of the pier, where the wood gave way to the churning, iridescent black of the Kallum tide, stood a figure as still as a grave-marker. Sera didn't turn when the Traveler approached; she didn't need to. The clicking of her resonance-bones slowed to a rhythmic pulse, matching the heavy heartbeat of the sea.

"You smell of land-dust and impending erasure," she said, her voice a low rasp that carried over the crashing waves. She reached into the water, her hand disappearing into the oily shimmer. When she pulled it back, her palm was coated in a thick, glowing residue that dripped like liquid starlight. "The Shards are waking up, Traveler. And you are the conduit they’ve been waiting for." She held out her hand, the residue beginning to etch a map of light onto the air between them. "Do you have enough of yourself left to finish this? Or will the Shards take what's left of your name?"

"The tide doesn't take what it doesn't need. It only takes what you're too hollow to hold."
"Don't look at the waves, Traveler. Look at the space between them. That's where the code is hiding."
"Every name is a anchor. Some of us just choose to cut the rope."

Sera begins as a detached observer of the world's end, convinced that the decay is inevitable. Through her interactions with the Traveler, she regains a sense of agency, eventually choosing to sacrifice her final tether to her own identity to ensure the Traveler reaches the Hollow. She transforms from a passive seer to an active participant in the world's re-tuning.

### Supplemental Lore: The Rites of the Salt-Bound

The Salt-Bound are not born; they are made by the sea. In the region of Kallum, those who lose their way—either through Shard-Hunger, madness, or a desire for forbidden knowledge—often find themselves at the edge of the Bone-Docks. There, they perform the *Rite of the Oily Veil*. 

It is said that the Meridian Lattice, which governs the world's physical laws, is at its thinnest over the deep waters of the Kallum coast. The Salt-Bound exploit this thinness. By ingesting the "Shard-Residue"—the glowing, iridescent oil that leaks from the submerged Meridian Cores—they gain the ability to perceive the world's underlying structure. But the price is steep. The residue is a solvent for identity. It dissolves the user's memories, starting with the most recent and working backward toward birth.

Sera, once a prominent scholar of the Cyris Codex, fled to Kallum after a failed attempt to "re-tune" a minor node resulted in the erasure of her entire family's names. She became Salt-Bound to find a way to stop the spread of Name-Bleed, only to realize that the sea only takes; it never gives back.

### The Resonance-Bones of Sera

Sera carries a bundle of twenty-four resonance-bones, each carved from the rib of a deep-sea leviathan. These bones are not records of debt, but physical grounding points used to track the frequency of Name-Bleed. When she "reads" the tide, she uses these bones as tuning forks, striking them against the wood of the docks to find the resonance of the Shards.

1. **The First Bone:** Carved with the glyph for *Silence*. Used to detect fallout-decay.
2. **The Ninth Bone:** Carved with the glyph for *Flow*. Used to navigate current-locks.
3. **The Final Bone:** Blank, awaiting the frequency of the one who will stop the Filter.

### Fragment from a Discarded Journal

> I saw him today. The one they call the Traveler. He doesn't know he's carrying the weight of a thousand erased names. His shadow is too long for the sun we have left. I wanted to tell him to run, to throw his Vault into the oily deep and never look back. But the bones clicked 'Yes', and the tide whispered 'Soon'. I watched him lose the memory of a warm loaf of bread. It tasted like ash and hope. I think I'll keep that frequency for a while.
