Neth Chainwarden — The Keeper of the Ash-Links

Slug: neth_chainwarden.md
Region: Sahru

A solitary guardian of the ruined Sahru trade plazas, Neth uses a network of "Ash-Links"—heavy, glyph-etched chains—to bind the drifting name-revenants of the wastes. He is a man of few words, his soul as parched as the black sands he treads.

Neth is tall and gaunt, his body wrapped in layers of grey, ash-stained bandages. He wears a heavy cowl that hides most of his face, leaving only his glowing, amber eyes visible. He is draped in heavy iron chains that clink and drag behind him, each link etched with a protective ward. He carries a massive, hooked polearm used to snag and anchor spirits. He smells of dry earth, old bone, and the metallic tang of the Name-Bleed.

Neth serves as a guardian and a source of grim warnings. He provides the Traveler with the "Chain-Wards" needed to traverse the Sunken Wastes without losing their identity to the hungry shadows of the past.

The rhythmic *clink-drag* of his chains across the sand and the low, vibrating hum of the iron links as they sense nearby spirits.

Neth binds the spirits of the dead to prevent them from consuming the living, yet he himself is slowly being consumed by the very chains he uses, his own name being etched link by link into the iron.

- Act I — Ch. 12 (The Black Sand Plazas): Neth intercepts the Traveler at the edge of the Sahru wastes, testing their resolve and eventually granting them a single Ash-Link for protection.
- Act II — Ch. 24 (The Echoing Ruin): Neth and the Traveler are trapped in a name-storm; Neth uses his own life-force to anchor the chains, allowing the Traveler to reach the eye of the storm.
- Act III — Ch. 32 (The Final Link): Neth becomes the "Anchor" for the Traveler’s final ascent to the Hollow, his chains stretching across the void to provide a physical path through the Absence.

The wind in Sahru was a thirsty thing, scouring the skin and whispering half-forgotten names into the Traveler’s ears. The black sand shifted underfoot, revealing the bleached ribs of long-dead cities. And there, standing atop a mound of fused glass, was Neth. He didn't move as the Traveler approached, the heavy iron chains draped over his shoulders as still as the desert air.

"You have a name," Neth said, his voice a dry rasp that sounded like sand on stone. "In Sahru, that is a dangerous thing to carry. The shadows here are hungry, and they remember what you have forgotten." He stepped down from the mound, the chains *clink-dragging* behind him with a sound that felt like it was pulling on the Traveler’s very soul. "I bind the hunger. I anchor the lost. But I cannot anchor a man who is already drifting." He held out a single, heavy link of iron, the glyphs on its surface glowing with a faint, warning light. "Take this. If you feel your name slipping, hold onto the chain. It will remind you of who you were. Even if the world forgets."

> *Entry:* 909 R, Cycle 4
> *Observation:* The Name-Bleed is reaching critical levels in the South Plaza. The revenants are no longer just whispers; they are becoming physical.
> *Action:* Deployed the Great Chain. Anchored three high-resonance shadows. 
> *Personal Note:* My left arm is now entirely iron. The chains are heavy today. I can no longer remember the color of my mother's eyes. The iron has taken that memory to fuel the wards. The Traveler passed today. He didn't look back. I hope he finds what he's looking for before he becomes part of my collection.

"A chain is only as strong as the name it anchors. And your name is very thin, Traveler."
"Don't listen to the sand. It only tells you what you want to hear. And in Sahru, that's usually a lie."
"I am the warden of what remains. And there is so very little left."

Neth begins as a detached, almost mechanical figure, his humanity buried under layers of duty and iron. Through his interactions with the Traveler, he begins to remember the value of a single life, even in a world that is losing its meaning. He moves from being a "jailer of ghosts" to a "protector of the living," eventually giving his final link—and his final memory—to save the Traveler.

## Faction: The White Hand (Zealots)
- **Motivation:** They believe the World Shards are "Cosmic Demons" that have possessed Maer. They view the Celestials as jailers and the Shards as the keys to a hell they want to avoid.
- **Goal:** Destroy the Shards and execute the "Possessed Librarian" (Maer) to purify Aethelgard.

## Moral Contradictions
- They seek purity, but they use the "Ash-Breathing" magic of the Fracture—a corrupted power—to achieve it.
- They want to destroy the Shards to save humanity, but they are willing to burn down every city to find them.

### Supplemental Lore: The Ash-Links of Sahru

In the Sunken Wastes, identity is a fluid and dangerous resource. The "Name-Bleed" is a phenomenon where the local Meridian Node has become so corrupted that it can no longer maintain the distinction between the past and the present. The result is a desert filled with "Revenants"—semi-physical echoes of people who have been erased from history.

The Chainwardens are the only ones who can survive in this environment. They use "Ash-Links," chains forged from iron and quenched in the blood of those who died during the Fracture. These chains act as "Metaphysical Anchors." By binding a revenant to a chain, a Warden can stabilize its identity, preventing it from merging with others and becoming a "Hunger-Swarm." However, the chains require a constant supply of "Identity-Energy" to maintain their wards, which they draw directly from the Warden.

### The Polearm of Neth

Neth’s weapon, the "Shadow-Hook," is designed to snag the energetic core of a revenant.

1. **The Hook:** Made of cold-iron and etched with 'Capture' glyphs.
2. **The Shaft:** Wrapped in the bandages of previous Wardens, providing a buffer against the Name-Bleed.

### Fragment from a Scoured Ledger

> I found a child's name today. It was floating near the edge of the glass-ruin, a small, blue spark of 'Home' and 'Mother'. I couldn't bind it. It was too small, too fragile. I watched it drift away into the black sand. The iron in my chest grew cold. I think that was the last of my pity. Tomorrow, I will bind the High-King's shadow. That one will be heavy.
