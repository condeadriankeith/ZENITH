Rian Mern — The Residue-Trader

Slug: rian_mern.md
Region: Mirel

A cunning and opportunistic trader from the mist-shrouded estuaries of Mirel, Rian deals in "Echoes"—audio-visual fragments of the past that have been caught in the region's dense Shard-Residue mist. He is a man of a thousand faces and a thousand stories, none of which are entirely true.

Rian is a man of medium height and nondescript features, the kind of person you forget the moment they leave the room. He wears a heavy, oilskin cloak that seems to change color to match the mist, and his belt is laden with dozens of small, lead-lined glass vials. Each vial contains a swirling, iridescent vapor—a captured Echo of the world before the Great Filter. He carries a "Mist-Lantern" that emits a soft, silver light, used to attract and reveal the hidden stories of the marsh. He smells of damp moss, old parchment, and the metallic tang of Arcane Fallout.

Rian serves as an information broker and a source of historical context. He provides the Traveler with the "Echo-Vials" needed to reconstruct the events of the Fracture and helps them navigate the deceptive social and physical landscape of Mirel.

The soft, rhythmic *clink* of the lead-lined vials on his belt and the faint, whispering voices that seem to emanate from his cloak.

## Relationship to World Shards
- **Motivation:** Rian trades in "Shard-Echoes." He believes the Shards are the ultimate power source in a dying world.
- **Goal:** Sell Maer a "Memory-Anchor"—a physical focus-device to slow his Name-Bleed.

## Moral Contradictions
- He is a residue-trader who is losing his own identity to the very mist he harvests.
- He claims to be a man of profit, but he is secretly giving away "Names" to those who have lost everything to the Blank Slate.

- Act I — Ch. 18 (The Whispering Estuary): Rian saves the Traveler from a "Liar-Mist" and sells them an Echo of the Fracture’s first moments, providing the first clue to the Architects' true motives.
- Act II — Ch. 30 (The Market of Memories): Rian helps the Traveler infiltrate a secret meeting of the Archivum, using his Echoes to create a perfect holographic disguise.
- Act III — Ch. 38 (The Silent Shore): Rian provides the Traveler with the "Final Echo"—a recording of the Architects' last command—which contains the harmonic sequence needed to unlock the Hollow.

The mist in Mirel was a living thing, a thick, grey soup that tasted of salt and secrets. It muffled every sound, turning the world into a series of disconnected, ghostly images. The Traveler was lost, the compass spinning uselessly in the damp air. Then, a soft, silver light flickered in the distance, and the sound of a thousand whispering voices began to fill the silence.

"Lost, are we?" Rian Mern said, stepping out of the mist with a grin that didn't quite reach his eyes. He held his Mist-Lantern high, the silver light revealing the glass vials hanging from his belt. One of the vials was pulsing with a rhythmic, golden light, the sound of a woman's laughter echoing faintly from within. "The mist here is full of holes, Traveler. You step in one place, and you end up fifty years ago. Or fifty years from now. It's all a matter of which story you're following." He unhooked a vial and held it out. "I have an Echo of a map. Very rare. Very accurate. It only costs a single secret. Do you have one you're looking to lose?"

"Truth is just a story that hasn't been edited yet."
"Don't believe everything you hear in the mist. Especially if it's coming from me."
"The past is a commodity, Traveler. And business is booming."

Rian begins as a purely self-interested charlatan, viewing the world's decay as just another market opportunity. Through his interactions with the Traveler, he begins to see the difference between "stories" and "truth." He moves from being a merchant of lies to a curator of reality, eventually giving his most valuable Echo—the truth of his own origin—to save the Traveler from a "Liar-Mist" trap.

### Supplemental Lore: The Echo-Vials of Mirel

In the shrouded coast of Mirel, the air is saturated with "Shard-Residue," a byproduct of the region's failing nodes. This residue has a tendency to "catch" sounds and images from the past, creating "Echoes"—localized distortions in reality that repeat a specific moment in time.

The Residue-Traders have developed the art of "Mist-Catching." Using specialized lanterns and lead-lined vials, they can trap an Echo and preserve it indefinitely. These Echoes are highly valued by historians, spies, and those simply looking for a piece of a world that no longer exists. However, the process of capturing and storing an Echo is not perfect. Over time, the Echo begins to degrade, its sounds and images becoming distorted and "remixed" by the merchant's own thoughts and desires. This is a form of secondary Name-Bleed, where the "names" of the past are slowly overwritten by the present.

### The Mist-Lantern of Rian

Rian’s lantern is more than a light source; it is a "Soni-Visual Filter" designed to protect the user from raw Shard-radiation while they work.

1. **The Silver-Oil:** A rare fuel that burns at a frequency that neutralizes local Name-Bleed.
2. **The Acoustic-Lens:** A series of glass plates that can be adjusted to "tune" the lantern to different frequencies of Echo.

> He didn't blink when I showed him the Fall. Most people scream, or cry, or try to run. He just watched. Like he'd seen it all before. Or like he was the one who did it. There's a 'Deep-Resonance' in him, something that goes back before the Fracture. I'm going to follow him. Not for the money. For the story. If he reaches the Hollow, it'll be the greatest Echo ever caught. I just hope I'm there to catch it.
