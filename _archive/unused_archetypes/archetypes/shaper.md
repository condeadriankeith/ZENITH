# Archetype: The Shaper (Thalen)

## Appearance
- **Clothing:** Woven vine-wraps and sap-stained tunics.
- **Tools:** A "Singing Knife" for pruning spirit-growth.
- **Markings:** Prismatic green-gold veins on the neck and wrists.

## Speech Samples
- "Listen to the rings; the grove remembers."
- "A name is not given; it is grown."
- "The sap flows thick today; the node is restless."

## Signature Magic
- **Spirit Magic:** Encouraging plants and structures to grow into desired shapes.
- **Cost:** Empathy drain; Shapers often become more connected to the grove than to their own families.

## Relationship to World Shards
- **Perspective:** Shapers view the Veridian Shard (Root) as the heart of Aethelgard. They fear the Celestials' reset because it would erase the "World-Memory" they have spent generations growing.
- **Goal:** Protect the Veridian Shard from the Magistrates and help Maer stabilize the Name-Bleed using spirit-rites.

## Moral Contradictions
- They claim to be stewards of life, but they are willing to sacrifice human "compost" to keep the spirit-bridges alive.
- They fear the Shards' power, yet they secretly hunger for the Veridian Shard to make their groves eternal.

## Arc Beats
1. **The Naming:** Successfully growing a spirit-bridge for the community.
2. **The Rejection:** A grove refuses a Shaper's song, indicating deep node corruption.
3. **The Sacrifice:** Trading a personal memory to heal a dying "Place-Spirit."
