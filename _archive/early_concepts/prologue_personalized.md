# Narrative Scene: Prologue Personalized — *The Shattered Meridian*

The ruin was a tooth of jagged rock jutting out of the Central Plain, a place where the leylines converged and then died. The Traveler stood before the altar, his travel-stained coat flapping in the dry wind. 

He had not come here for glory. He had come for a name. 

Years before, in a valley that no longer remembered its own name, he had traded the single word his mother sang at him to sleep so the village might wake. The lullaby had left his mouth like a coin into the sea; every time he thought of it, a part of him ached with the size of that debt. This ruin held one possibility: to reweave a name back into the world, or to tear one so whole that no one could speak at all. 

That is why he touched the Book.

As his left hand made contact with the black-reed binding, the triune helix of runes beneath the altar flared into life. Prismatic light, like oil-on-water, flowed up his arm, making the scar on his wrist pulse with a fierce, cold heat. 

"In places afflicted by quarantine the air takes on a metallic tang, and wells hum a steady, reedy tone," he whispered, the words a shield against the sudden pressure in his head. 

The Book didn't just contain knowledge; it contained weight. The weight of every name lost since the Fracture, every memory pruned by the Great Filter. He felt the Meridian Veil pressing against his mind, a vast, procedural lattice that saw him only as a breach to be corrected.

But he didn't pull away. He couldn't. He had made a promise to an Archivist who was now nothing more than a memory-echo in the mist. 

"Mortals should not meddle," a voice seemed to hum from the very stones of the ruin. 

"I'm not meddling," the Traveler gritted his teeth, his eyes turning to white-void as the patterns of the Book began to merge with his own. "I'm paying the debt."

With a final, agonizing surge of energy, the Hollow Lock clicked. Not open, but... adjusted. The silence of the ruin was broken by the sound of a thousand bells tolling at once, a threadbare chorus that echoed across the plains.

He pulled his hand back, gasping for air. The Book was still there, but it was different now. And so was he. 

The path was clear. Cyris, Virek, Thalen, Kallum. He had to find the pieces. He had to reweave the world, or watch it bleed into nothingness.

He adjusted his pack and stepped out of the ruin, his shadow long and left-handed on the golden grass.
