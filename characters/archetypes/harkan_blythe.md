Harkan Blythe — The Iron-Clad Outcast

Slug: harkan_blythe.md
Region: Eirn

A rogue blacksmith and former member of the Eirn Clan-Council, Harkan was exiled for his "Forbidden-Foraging"—the practice of using corrupted Meridian-iron to create weapons. He is a man of grim determination and heavy silence, his body covered in the scars of his craft.

Harkan is a broad-shouldered man, his skin the color of cold ash. He wears a heavy suit of mismatched iron armor, much of it etched with defensive runes that glow with a faint, sickly green light. His right arm is encased in a massive, steam-powered gauntlet used for handling superheated metal. He carries a heavy, iron-bound hammer and a bundle of "Corrupted-Rods"—strips of iron taken from failing nodes. He smells of coal-smoke, sulfur, and the sharp, metallic scent of heated iron.

Harkan serves as a provider of heavy weaponry and armor. He provides the Traveler with the "Iron-Clad Wards" needed to survive the physical manifestations of the Fracture and helps them understand the dangerous potential of corrupted materials.

The rhythmic *clank-hiss* of his steam-gauntlet and the low, gutteral hum of the corrupted iron he carries.

## Relationship to World Shards
- **Motivation:** Harkan believes the Shards are "Cosmic Iron." He wants to use the Crimson Shard to reinforce the shields of the outcasts.
- **Goal:** Defend Maer from the White Hand using a "Shard-Resonant" shield.

## Moral Contradictions
- He is an outcast who seeks to protect the very society that rejected him.
- He uses his shield to block the "Name-Bleed," but the shield is slowly eating his hands.

- Act I — Ch. 6 (The Iron-Clad Forge): Harkan saves the Traveler from a group of "Node-Scavengers," using his steam-gauntlet to crush their constructs and eventually agreeing to repair the Traveler's armor.
- Act II — Ch. 20 (The Corrupted Vein): Harkan and the Traveler infiltrate a failing mine to retrieve a "Pure-Iron" core, a journey that requires Harkan to use his own body as a shield against the node-rot.
- Act III — Ch. 32 (The Final Forge): Harkan stays behind to defend the entrance to the Hollow, using his corrupted weapons to create a "Wall of Iron" that holds back the advancing Absence-Wraiths.

The forge in the Eirn mountains was a place of shadows and flickering orange light. The air was thick with the scent of burning coal and the metallic tang of heated iron. Harkan Blythe stood at the anvil, his massive steam-gauntlet hissing as he hammered a piece of glowing, green-tinted metal. Every strike sent a shower of sparks across the room, illuminating the deep scars on his face.

"You're carrying a lot of light for someone in such a dark place, Traveler," Harkan said, his voice a low rumble that sounded like grinding stones. He didn't look up as the Traveler approached, his focus entirely on the metal. "In Eirn, we say that the iron remembers the hands that forged it. This iron remembers the Fracture. It's angry. It's hungry. And it's the only thing that will keep you alive in the wastes." He plunged the metal into a vat of black oil, a cloud of foul-smelling steam filling the room. He held up the finished blade, the green light reflecting in his eyes. "Take it. It's a heavy burden, but a light one won't do you any good where you're going."

> *Sentence:* Permanent exile from the Clan-Lands; stripping of all guild honors.
> *Notes:* The subject's obsession with 're-forging the Fracture' has led him into dangerous and forbidden territory. His work is a blight upon the honor of the Clans. Any member found in contact with him will face similar punishment.

"The world is a piece of hot iron. If you don't hammer it into shape, it'll burn your hands off."
"Honor is a luxury we can no longer afford. Survival is the only law that matters now."
"Don't trust the light. Trust the weight. The weight is the only thing that's real."

Harkan begins as a man who has accepted his role as a pariah, convinced that his work is a necessary evil. Through his journey with the Traveler, he begins to see the possibility of "Pure-Forging"—a way to use his skills to heal rather than just to protect. He moves from being a "smith of shadows" to a "forger of hope," eventually giving his life to ensure that the Traveler has the tools needed to re-tune the world.

### Supplemental Lore: The Corrupted-Forging of Harkan

In the Frostbound Oathlands, iron is considered a sacred material, a physical manifestation of the world's stability. "Pure-Iron" is iron that has been mined from healthy nodes and forged according to the strict laws of the Clans. "Corrupted-Iron," however, is iron that has been exposed to the raw energy of the Fracture. It is brittle, unpredictable, and carries a "Node-Taint" that can infect the user's mind and body.

Harkan Blythe has spent his life studying the properties of this corrupted metal. He has developed techniques to "bind" the node-energy within the iron, creating weapons and armor that are incredibly powerful but also dangerous to use. This "Corrupted-Forging" requires the use of specialized tools, such as his steam-powered gauntlet, which provides the necessary pressure and temperature to manipulate the unstable metal. However, the constant exposure to the taint has left Harkan’s body covered in "Iron-Scars"—places where the metal has literally fused with his flesh.

### The Steam-Gauntlet of Harkan

Harkan’s gauntlet is a masterpiece of "Rogue-Technomancy."

1. **The Pressure-Valve:** Allows Harkan to release bursts of superheated steam to power his strikes or create a distraction.
2. **The Heat-Shield:** Protects Harkan’s arm from the extreme temperatures of the corrupted forge.

### Fragment from a Smudged Notebook

> The Traveler's compass is not made of iron. It's made of 'Memory-Brass'. I've never seen anything like it. It doesn't just point; it *remembers*. I tried to touch it, and the metal screamed. He is the one the Oracle spoke of. The one who will 'Re-Forge the World'. I'll give him the Iron-Clad Ward. It won't save him, but it'll buy him enough time to do what needs to be done.
