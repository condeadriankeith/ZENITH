Yori Runehound — The Shadow-Hunter

Slug: yori_runehound.md
Region: Sahru

A relentless and highly-skilled tracker from the sunken wastes of Sahru, Yori is a "Runehound"—a specialized hunter trained to track the "Name-Bleed" left behind by the region's revenants. He is a man of intense focus and few words, his life dedicated to the eradication of the "Shadow-Eaters" that plague the wastes.

Yori is a lean, athletic man with skin the color of dark ash. He wears a suit of rugged, sand-stained leather and a series of "Rune-Collars"—specialized iron bands used for binding and neutralizing node-energy—strapped to his arms and neck. His eyes are a sharp, piercing violet, and he carries a "Shadow-Spear"—a long, obsidian blade etched with tracking-glyphs. He is accompanied by a "Rune-Wolf"—a spectral creature made of condensed node-residue that he uses to find the invisible trails of his prey. He smells of dry earth, ozone, and the sharp, metallic scent of blood.

Yori serves as a tracker and a source of martial support. He provides the Traveler with the "Rune-Collars" needed to bind the local node-energy and helps them navigate the dangerous and deceptive environment of the wastes.

The low, constant growl of his rune-wolf and the rhythmic *shink* of his shadow-spear as he draws it from its sheath.

## Faction: The White Hand (Zealots)
- **Motivation:** Yori is a hunter of "Name-Bleeders." She believes that anyone touched by a Shard is already dead, replaced by a celestial parasite.
- **Goal:** Scent the trail of the Azure Shard and put Maer "out of his misery."

## Moral Contradictions
- She claims to be a protector of the innocent, but she treats victims of Name-Bleed with a cold, clinical brutality.
- She uses her own Name-Bleed to track Maer, justifying her corruption as a necessary sacrifice.

- Act I — Ch. 12 (The Ash-Wastes): Yori saves the Traveler from a "Name-Swarm," using his wolf and spear to neutralize the revenants and eventually agreeing to guide the Traveler across the wastes.
- Act II — Ch. 24 (The Sunken Temple): Yori and the Traveler navigate a maze of "Shadow-Traps," a journey that requires Yori to manually adjust his collars to compensate for the erratic node-energy.
- Act III — Ch. 36 (The Final Hunt): Yori stays behind to defend the entrance to the Hollow against a massive wave of "Shadow-Eaters," using his wolf and spear to create a path for the Traveler.

The wastes of Sahru were a sea of black sand and glass-fused ruins, the air thick with the scent of ozone and the constant, low growl of the rune-wolf. Yori Runehound stood at the edge of a deep crater, his shadow-spear glowing with a faint, violet light as he traced a pattern in the sand.

"The shadows are moving, Traveler," Yori said, his voice a low, gravelly rasp. He didn't look up as the Traveler approached, his focus entirely on the sand. "And they're not moving according to the patterns. The name-bleed is reaching critical levels, and the revenants are starting to swarm." He stepped back from the crater, his violet eyes wide with a mixture of excitement and terror. "The Fracture isn't just a crack in the world. It's a feast. And if we don't find a way to stop it, there won't be any names left to hunt." He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, iron collar. "Take this. It'll tell you when the shadows are about to turn into a feast. And believe me, where you're going, that happens more often than you'd think."

> *Hunter:* Yori Runehound
> *Mission:* Track the 'Shadow-Eaters' of Sector 9.
> *Status:* Complete. Shadow-jitter is exceeding safety parameters.
> *Notes:* I saw a 'Static-Point' in the sand today. A man with a compass that doesn't tick. I've given him a collar and a path. He moves like he's already part of the shadows. I'll follow him for a while. If he reaches the Hollow, the hunt will finally be complete.

"The shadow isn't a lack of light; it's a lack of name. And I'm the one who knows how to find it."
"Don't trust the silence. The silence is where the shadows hide."
"Every rune has a cost. And the cost of the hunt is your soul."

Yori begins as a stoic and dedicated hunter, viewing the world's decay as just another prey to be tracked. Through his interactions with the Traveler, he realizes that his "hunt" is actually a race against time. He moves from being a "tracker of shadows" to a "guardian of names," eventually choosing to use his rune-wolf to provide the Traveler with the "Sonic-Key" needed to reach the Hollow's core.

### Supplemental Lore: The Rune-Wolves of Sahru

In the sunken wastes of Sahru, the Meridian Lattice is so thin that the local nodes can only be perceived through the "Sense of the Beast." The "Rune-Wolves" are spectral creatures created by the Runehounds to navigate this environment.

These wolves are not biological in the traditional sense; they are "Resonant-Constructs" made from high-purity node-residue that has been "tuned" to the frequency of the region's revenants. By bonding with a wolf, a skilled hunter can "see" the invisible trails of the "Shadow-Eaters" and predict their movements. However, the process is extremely taxing on the hunter's mind and body. Constant exposure to the high-intensity vibrations of the wolf can lead to "Resonance-Madness," a condition where the hunter's own internal sense of self becomes detached from reality, leading to hallucinations, memory loss, and a frantic, obsessive need to keep hunting.

### The Shadow-Spear of Yori

Yori’s weapon is more than a blade; it is a "Metaphysical Siphon."

1. **The Obsidian-Blade:** Provides the hardness needed to break through the "Shadow-Shields" of the revenants.
2. **The Tracking-Glyphs:** Etched into the blade, these glyphs allow Yori to "hook" a specific name and pull it from the shadows.

### Fragment from a Hunter's Diary

> He didn't blink when the shadows took him. Most people panic. They try to scream, to make any kind of noise to prove they're still real. He just nodded and followed. He is a man who is already comfortable with the dark. I've given him the Collar. It's the only thing that can protect him from the 'Scream' of the Hollow. I'll stay here, in the wastes. I'll make sure the Absence doesn't follow him.
