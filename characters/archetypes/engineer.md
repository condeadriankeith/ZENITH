# Archetype: The Engineer (Virek)

## Appearance
- **Clothing:** Oily leather aprons and brass-rimmed goggles.
- **Tools:** Runic wrenches and steam-pressure gauges.
- **Markings:** Faint schematic-like burns on the forearms.

## Speech Samples
- "Check the bandwidth; the node is peaking."
- "This rune is out of patent; it's a safety risk."
- "The Mercury-Keel didn't fail; it was just ahead of its time."

## Signature Magic
- **Technomancy:** Etching functional runes into brass and iron.
- **Cost:** Material consumption; Engineers are always hunting for rare ores and node-residue.

## Faction: Virek Engineers
- **Motivation:** They view the World Shards as the ultimate power source. They believe the Celestials are "wasteful" with the world's energy and that humanity should take control of its own mechanics.
- **Goal:** Capture Maer and "dissect" the Shards to fuel a new age of synthetic godhood.

## Moral Contradictions
- They claim to be men of science, yet they treat their machines with a superstitious reverence that rivals the Magistrates.
- They want to save the world from the Great Filter, but their industry accelerates the very decay they seek to stop.

## Arc Beats
1. **The Invention:** Creating a device that uses 10% less Meridian energy.
2. **The Rupture:** Surviving a foundry explosion caused by a Great Filter Lock.
3. **The Discovery:** Finding a way to "re-tune" a minor node without triggering a seal.
