# Archetype: The Magistrate (Cyris)

## Appearance
- **Clothing:** Stiff, white-chalked robes with embroidered ledger-lines.
- **Tools:** A portable marble stylus and a small vial of "Oathtaker's Ink."
- **Markings:** Inked thumbprints on the palms, representing years of adjudicating bindings.

## Speech Samples
- "By the Pillar of Oaths, this contract is binding."
- "The ledger does not forget, even if you do."
- "Show me your thumb-mark; let the Meridian witness your intent."

## Signature Magic
- **Covenant Magic:** Creating white fissure lines that physically bind two parties to an agreement.
- **Cost:** Magistrates often lose the ability to dream of anything other than law and order.

## Faction: The Magistrates
- **Motivation:** They worship the Celestials as the ultimate arbiters of order. They enforce the **Law of Silence** with religious fervor, believing that any mortal who speaks a True Name or touches a World Shard is a threat to the world's stability.
- **Goal:** Capture the "Keeper of the Vault" (Maer) and return the Shards to the Star-Altar at the Zenith.

## Moral Contradictions
- They claim to serve the world's stability, yet they are willing to "prune" entire bloodlines to maintain the Law of Silence.
- They worship the Celestials, but they fear the "Great Filter" just as much as the common people.

## Arc Beats
1. **The Strict Adherent:** Enforcing a minor law that has devastating human consequences.
2. **The Doubt:** Witnessing a node failure that the law cannot fix.
3. **The Compromise:** Using an unsanctioned rite to save a community.
