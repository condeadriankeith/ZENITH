# Character Relationships — *ZENITH*

This document maps the primary relationships between the characters of the Shattered Meridian, categorized by their alignment, nature, and the strength of their connection.

## Core Narrative Dynamics

- **Maer vs. Eldra Voss (Virek):** **Uneasy Alliance.** Eldra is a brilliant Virek engineer who wants the Vault to power her God-Engines; Maer needs her specialized tech to stabilize the Shards within the Vault. They are bound by mutual necessity and mutual distrust.
- **Maer vs. Oren Valis (Magistrate):** **The Hunter.** Valis is a high-ranking Magistrate who views Maer as a "biological hazard." He wants to "silence" Maer—not necessarily by killing him, but by neutralizing his connection to the Shards to protect the order of Meridian.
- **Maer vs. The White Hand:** **The Prey.** To the cultists of the Ashlands, Maer is not a man; he is a vessel of "Divine Blood." They hunt him relentlessly, intending to crack him open and consume the prismatic magic to accelerate their own evolution.
