**Archetype:** The "Mad Mechanic" 
 
## Physical Description 
* **Appearance:** Small, wiry frame. Skin stained permanently with coal-dust and grease. 
* **Eyes:** Bright, piercing orange (a side effect of "Furnace-Gaze," a mild mutation from staring into Shard-Engines). 
* **Gear:** Wears a "Harness of Gauges" (brass pressure dials strapped to her chest/arms). Carries a massive, rune-etched wrench. 
* **Hair:** A wild, unkempt mane of chemical red. 
 
## Personality & Voice 
* **Voice:** Fast, clipped, rhythmic (like a ticking clock). She interrupts people. She hates silence. 
* **Motivation:** Survival. She doesn't care about history; she cares about *pressure*. If the pressure gets too high, the city explodes. 
* **Relationship to Maer:** She thinks he is "soft" and "useless" until he proves his logic skills. She calls him "Scribe." 
 
## Abilities 
* **Technomancy:** Can "read" machines. She hits things to fix them, but knows exactly *where* to hit. 
* **The Vault:** She is the only living person who knows how to build a Lead-Lined Runed Cylinder to contain Shard radiation.
