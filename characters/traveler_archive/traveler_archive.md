# Traveler Archive — *The Shattered Meridian*

## The Traveler
- **Name:** [NONE]
- **Attributes:** Nameless, left-handed, carries a heavy pack of forbidden knowledge.
- **Emotional Anchors:**
    1. **Mother’s Name (Traded):** He hums a lullaby but cannot recall the name of the woman who sang it.
    2. **Failed Rescue (Plague Child):** The memory of blank eyes he could not save.
    3. **Archivist Mentor (Lost):** A promise to finish the work of the one who disappeared.

## Prologue Personalization
> He had not come here for glory. He had come for a name. Years before, in a valley that no longer remembered its own name, he had traded the single word his mother sang at him to sleep so the village might wake. The lullaby had left his mouth like a coin into the sea; every time he thought of it, a part of me aches with the size of that debt. This ruin held one possibility: to reweave a name back into the world, or to tear one so whole that no one could speak at all. That is why he touched the Book.

## Polished Journal Fragments

### Fragment 01: The Left Wrist
*The scar on my left wrist hums whenever I get close to a node. It’s a reminder of the first bargain I made—the one where I didn’t know the price until it was too late. Maer. That was the name I gave to the anchor. Now the valley breathes, and I am empty of that word. Every time I try to hum the lullaby, the last verse slides away like sand.*

### Fragment 02: The Archivist's Slip
*I found it tucked into the binding of a Cyris ledger: ‘Hollow Seal: pair a star-shard with three ledger bones.’ The handwriting was frantic, the ink smudged by sweat or tears. They were terrified. I told them I would find the pieces. I’ve always been good at keeping other people’s secrets, even if I can’t keep my own.*

### Fragment 03: The Black Sands
*The air in Sahru tastes like old pennies. It’s the metallic tang of a world that’s forgotten how to be. I saw a child today who didn’t know their own name—not because they’d forgotten, but because the name itself had bled out of the soil. The Great Filter isn’t just a lock; it’s an erasure.*

## Map Notes
- **Valen Crossroads:** The node is loud here. Too many rumors, too many runes. It’s a place for hiding in plain sight.
- **Thalen Groves:** The spirits are suspicious. They smell the left-hand rites on me. I have to be careful with my songs.
- **The Hollow:** The center of the slam. The Book is waiting.
