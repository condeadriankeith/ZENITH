# Traveler — Maer, Keeper of the Vault

**Canonical/internal name:** Maer  
**Title:** Keeper of the Vault
**Role:** Former Librarian of the High Peaks Archive

## Overview

- **Name:** Maer.
- **Role:** Once a humble librarian in the archives of the High Peaks, Maer is now the **Keeper of the Vault**. He is the one who shattered the obsidian sphere at the Zenith, scattering the Five Shards to prevent the Celestial Reset.
- **Backstory:** While studying the ancient Azure Shard in the archives, Maer discovered the truth about the **Great Filter**—the Celestials' plan to wipe Aethelgard clean. He stole the Azure Shard and journeyed to the Zenith to break the Vault, inheriting the burden of the Shards.
- **Left-hand motif:** His left hand is permanently stained with the iridescent "Name-Bleed" from the Azure Shard. He uses it to channel the raw power of the Shards he collects.
- **Physical description:** Lean, weather-beaten, wearing the robes of a librarian now reinforced with leather and brass. His left hand glows with a shifting, prismatic light that never fades. His eyes reflect the indigo depth of the Zenith sky.

## The Burden: Name-Bleed

As the Keeper of the Vault, Maer is the only one capable of holding the World Shards, but he is not immune to their cost.
- **Memory Famine:** To house the Azure Shard (and any subsequent Shards), Maer's own memories are being systematically replaced by cosmic data. He has already forgotten the face of his mentor and the name of his home village.
- **Identity-Vacuum:** Maer no longer exists in the official records of Aethelgard. To the Celestials and their Magistrates, he is a "Null-Subject"—a glitch in the Law of Silence.

## Abilities & Shards

- **The Azure Shard (Mind/Memory):** Maer's first and primary Shard. It allows him to see the "Definition-lines" of the world and read the memories of objects.
- **Vault-Breaker:** Maer can interact with Celestial structures that are normally impenetrable to mortals.
- **Reweaving:** Using the Shards, Maer can temporarily override the Law of Silence, though doing so accelerates his own Name-Bleed.

## Knowledge

As a former Librarian of the High Peaks Archive, Maer is one of the few living souls who has read the unredacted version of the *Codex of the First Breath*. This forbidden knowledge is what led him to discover the truth about the "Reset" and the impending activation of the Great Filter. This understanding of the cycle is what fuels his desperate mission to shatter the Vault.

## Inventory & Status

- **The Vault:** A physical containment unit (the shattered obsidian sphere's core) used to safely house collected Shards. It hums with a low-frequency vibration that Maer uses to ground himself.
- **Librarian's Satchel:** Contains ink, parchment (for recording what he forgets), and basic survival tools.
- **Condition (Advanced Name-Bleed):** Maer is in the late stages of cognitive erosion. He no longer carries a "Ledger of Debts"—there is no debt to pay, only a biological clock ticking. His mission is a race against his own mind; he must finish the re-sealing before his consciousness becomes a blank slate.

## The Physical Corruption Arc

- **Act I (The Librarian):** Dusty robes, ink stains, normal eyes. Carries a leather satchel. He looks like a scholar out of his depth.
- **Act II (The Fugitive):** First Runes of prismatic light appear on his forearms. Skin is unnaturally pale. Carries the Vault—a heavy metal scroll case that hums with a reedy vibration.
- **Act III (The Catalyst):** Eyes turn violet (Name-Bleed). Veins in his neck and hands glow with liquid light. Voice becomes raspy, like grinding stone. The Vault is now fused to his back straps, its weight immovable.
- **Act IV (The Conduit):** Skin is translucent, revealing a skeleton that glows violet. He moves with a jagged, artificial grace. He looks more like a Celestial Construct than a man.

## Narrative Role

Maer is a man who chose to save the world by stealing its future. He is hunted by the Magistrates for his "heresy" and sought by the Virek Engineers for his power. His journey is one of tragic inheritance: to save Aethelgard, he must slowly cease to be a part of it.
