# Maer — The Vault-Keeper

**Canonical Name:** Maer  
**Title:** The Vault-Keeper  
**Role:** Former Archivist of the Grand Athenaeum (Cyris)  

## Overview

- **Name:** Maer.
- **Role:** Once a lowly archivist in the Grand Athenaeum of Cyris, Maer is now the **Vault-Keeper**. He is the one who carries the Shards of the world to prevent the "Celestial Reset."
- **Backstory:** While cleaning the forbidden vaults, Maer discovered *The Codex of the First Breath*. This forbidden knowledge revealed the Great Filter—the Celestials' plan to reset the world. He stole the Codex and the Azure Shard, setting off a chain of events that would see him hunting for the remaining four Shards.
- **Protagonist Goal:** To collect all five Shards, climb the Zenith, and shatter the system of the Celestials to save the world below.
- **Antagonist:** Val-Kora (The Celestial), who enforces the Great Filter.

## The Burden: The Bleed & Shard Effects

As the Vault-Keeper, Maer's body and mind are the containment vessels for the Shards. Each Shard grants immense power but exacts a devastating toll.

- **Azure Shard (Mind):** 
  - *Power:* Spike in intelligence, ability to see patterns and predict movements.
  - *Cost:* Loss of sleep. The "Bleed" erases small, common nouns from his memory.
- **Veridian Shard (Life):**
  - *Power:* Rapid healing, control over organic growth.
  - *Cost:* Veins turn green. Loss of the memory of pain, leading to reckless behavior.
- **Crimson Shard (Body):**
  - *Power:* Tripled strength, hardened skin (armor-like).
  - *Cost:* Loss of empathy. Erases the names and memories of loved ones.
- **Violet Shard (Entropy):**
  - *Power:* Control over decay and gravity.
  - *Cost:* Becomes "Hollow"—cold, logical, and terrifyingly detached from humanity.
- **Gold Shard (Law):**
  - *Power:* The ability to rewrite the rules of reality and project truth into the sky.
  - *Cost:* Burning of all remaining memories to sustain the power.

## Physical Evolution Arc

- **Part I (The Archivist):** Dusty robes, ink-stained fingers, unassuming appearance.
- **Part II (The Fugitive):** Carries the Vault (Lead/Runed Cylinder). Silver nosebleeds (Azure stress). Green veins beginning to show (Veridian).
- **Part III (The Juggernaut):** Skin hardens, movements become heavy and powerful. Prismatic light leaks from his eyes.
- **Part IV (The Conduit):** Translucent skin, glowing skeleton. He looks more like a Celestial Construct than a man. Ends as "The Statue" at the Star-Altar.

## Narrative Role

Maer is the "Vault-Keeper," a tragic figure who must empty himself of everything that makes him human to save humanity. He is a man defying the inevitable "Long Descent" of his world.
