# Style Guide: The Writing Constitution

## Voice & Tone
- **Voice:** Third-Person Limited (Maer). 
- **Style:** Sensory-heavy, high contrast. Cinematic Wide → Medium → Close sequencing for scene openings.

## The "Magic" Aesthetic
- **Terminology:** NEVER use "Mana" or "Spells." Use **"Resonance,"** **"Frequency,"** or **"Shards."**
- **Visuals:** Magic looks like **"Prismatic Oil,"** **"Liquid Light,"** or **"Fractured Glass."**
- **Sensory:** Magic tastes like ozone, copper, and battery acid. It makes teeth ache and creates a reedy hum in the marrow.

## The "Name-Bleed" Effect
- **The Cost:** When Maer uses power, describe a specific cognitive loss. 
  - *Example:* "The memory of the taste of bread vanished," or "He could no longer recall the color of his mother's eyes."
- **Progression:** It starts as a sensory hum and progresses to identity erosion, eventually leading to becoming "Hollow."

## Technology & Faction Visuals
- **Magistrates:** Clean white stone, gold filigree, oppressive silence, administrative order.
- **Virek:** Rust, neon green, hissing steam, bulky metal, industrial grime.
- **White Hand:** Ash, obsidian, red cloth, mutated flesh, volcanic heat.

## Canonical Constraints
- **Canonical Line:** "Mortals should not meddle with the power of the Gods."
- **Left-Hand Motif:** Maer's left hand is his primary conduit; it should be mentioned at least once per major scene.
- **Exposition:** No single exposition paragraph should exceed 400 words.
